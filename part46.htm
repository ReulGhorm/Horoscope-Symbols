But there are two ways an aspect or aspect family can predominate. The chart may simply have a large number of aspects from the dominant family, without the pairs of aspecting planets being connected to each other. Or—and this is what will be discussed here—the chart may have a number of aspects from the dominant family, with each pair linked to the other pairs by the same type of aspect.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part45.htm#bookmark222" class="a">Figure </a>12 <span style=" color: #000;">shows the difference. In chart A, there are a number of unconnected squares, whereas in chart B all the squares are connected into what astrologers call a grand square or grand cross. The planets involved are ranged around the circle at 90° intervals so that each is in either square or opposition to the other planets in the cross.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As described above in the section on the square, a chart with a simple predominance of squares means a great deal of energy, often resulting in crises. When the squares are all connected as in chart B, the energy is greatly magnified and the crises are heightened. The reason for this is easy to see when you realize that a transiting or progressed aspect to one planet in the square is at the same time an aspect to all planets in the square.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part45.htm#bookmark222" class="s31">Looked at in terms of harmonic theory, it is as if two planets in square set up a wave that is 90° long. A wave of this length will repeat itself exactly four times as it travels around the 360° of the ecliptic. If there are four unconnected squares in a chart, the wave formed by one square will peak at a different set of points than the wave formed by another square (see </a><a href="part45.htm#bookmark222" class="a">Figure </a>12A<a href="part45.htm#bookmark222" class="s31">). But if the waves are connected by squares or oppositions to each other, they will all be in phase, with their peaks at the same four points on the ecliptic (see </a><a href="part45.htm#bookmark222" class="a">Figure </a>12B<span style=" color: #000;">). Thus peaks will reinforce peaks and troughs will reinforce troughs, and aspects arranged in this way will intensify one another.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part46.htm#bookmark225" class="s31" name="bookmark224">As indicated above, it is only necessary that the planets be connected by the same family of aspects—not that they all be connected by the same aspect. This is because aspects in the same family are related in the same way as a fundamental and its overtones are in music. To use a classic illustration of harmonics, a plucked guitar string vibrates not only in the fundamental tone but also, at the same time, in overtones. </a><a href="part46.htm#bookmark225" class="a">Figure </a>13 <span style=" color: #000;">shows a string vibrating as a whole, producing the fundamental tone; in halves, producing the octave or first overtone; in thirds, producing the second overtone; in fourths, producing the double octave or third overtone;</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">etc. We are here mostly concerned with the octave overtones, in which the fundamental wavelength is successively cut in half. Overtones besides the octave overtones are carried but are not relevant to this discussion. An opposition is one-half the wavelength of a conjunction, a square is one- fourth the wavelength of a conjunction, etc. Like the fundamental tone sounded on a vibrating guitar string, the conjunction carries within it overtones corresponding to the opposition, trine, square, sextile etc. Likewise, an opposition carries within it overtones of all octaves of the two-series higher than itself. In an aspect pattern like the grand square, the first overtones of the opposition are in exactly the same shape and position as the waves formed by the squares. In other words, the peaks and troughs of the opposition’s first overtone will be in exactly the same position as the peaks and troughs of the squares, thus providing the same reinforcing effect as was provided by all the squares in phase with one another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="81" alt="image" src="Image_031.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark225">Figure 13. Harmonics or overtones in a guitar string</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A grand square is one example of what I like to call a “harmonic syndrome.” “Syndrome” means literally “running together,” which is what the aspects in such a pattern are doing. In his heliocentric work, John Nelson has coined the phrase “simultaneous multiple harmonic” for the same sort of phenomenon, but I think “harmonic syndrome” says it more briefly and accurately.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Harmonic syndromes include the other aspect patterns long noted by astrologers: the grand trine (third-harmonic syndrome), T-square (fourth- harmonic), grand sextile or Star of David (sixth-harmonic), yod (twelfth- harmonic), and so forth. Not only does each of these patterns consist of several aspects of the same family, the aspects are also in phase with one another, so that the peaks of the waves formed by the aspects and overtones occur at the same points around the ecliptic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark226">The harmonic number of the syndrome comes from the highest- harmonic aspect in the syndrome. Thus a syndrome containing conjunctions, oppositions, squares, and semisquares or octiles would be called an eighth- harmonic syndrome, just as a grand square that also contains oppositions and perhaps even conjunctions would be called a fourth-harmonic</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">syndrome. In an eighth-harmonic syndrome, there would be eight repetitions of a wave going once around the ecliptic: eight peaks, or eight points equally spaced around the zodiac in which planets involved in the syndrome could be placed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As you may have noted, the T-square is a grand cross or fourth- harmonic syndrome with one arm empty. It is not necessary to have all the possible points in a harmonic syndrome filled, though of course the more points occupied, the stronger the effect. The higher the harmonic, the more rare it is to have all possible points filled, and in really high harmonics it is not even possible, because there are not enough planets to go around. Most astrologers have seen a number of grand trines and grand squares with all the possible points in the syndrome filled in, but they see a grand sextile, in which all six points in a sixth-harmonic syndrome are filled in, only once or twice in their careers. It is much more common to find sixth-harmonic syndromes in the form of minor grand trines, kites, and mystic rectangles, various patterns in which some of the six possible points are not filled. These patterns will be discussed below.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are some general rules regarding harmonic syndromes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">1. As mentioned above, the more planets involved, the stronger the syndrome. Thus, although squares are usually more powerful than septiles, if there are several planets involved in a seventh-harmonic syndrome, the septiles will collectively be stronger than a single pair of planets in square.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This is important because often horoscopes of people who have lives characteristic of a large number of squares may have no squares. Instead, you will find them to have many planets involved in an eighth-, sixteenth-or even a thirty-second-harmonic syndrome. There are also horoscopes that have a square that seems to act out of all proportion to a square’s normal effect. On looking closer, you will find that the square is strengthened by having other planets attached to it by eighth-, sixteenth-, or thirty-second-harmonic aspects. For the tie-in to be meaningful, the orbs have to be small, less than 1°.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">2. The syndrome unifies the chart according to the principle of the harmonic. I have already mentioned that the largest common divisor of the angles that make up a harmonic syndrome establishes the number of the harmonic syndrome. The largest common divisor also establishes the dominant symbolic quality. Thus in a syndrome containing trines, sextiles, and semisextiles, the overall symbolic quality would be of the semisextile or twelfth harmonic. But unlike a series of unconnected semisextiles, the twelfth-harmonic syndrome would also bring as an undertone the qualities of the trine and sextile, or the third and sixth harmonics.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark227">3. As stated above, when a transiting or progressed planet conjoins one of the planets in a natal harmonic syndrome, all the planets in the syndrome are set off at approximately the same time. A transiting or progressed planet can also set off a harmonic syndrome when it is making an aspect that is a multiple of the harmonic number of the syndrome. For example, a progressed planet might make a 22.5° (sixteenth-harmonic) angle to one of the planets in an eighth-harmonic syndrome, thus setting off the first overtone of the eighth harmonic and making the entire syndrome ring like a bell. Therefore, when one is checking transits or progressions to a harmonic syndrome, one should not overlook the seemingly minor aspects that are multiples of the harmonic in question.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">4. As mentioned in the previous chapter’s section on orbs, you can allow a larger-than-usual orb for a harmonic syndrome because of the way a syndrome increases the strength of the aspects involved in it. But, of course, the closer the average orb of the syndrome, the more powerful the syndrome is. As I will point out below, a close-orbed syndrome also differs from a wide-orbed one in quality as well as intensity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part45.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part47.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
