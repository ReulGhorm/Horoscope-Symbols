It does so by putting one back in contact with one’s source, one’s roots, the groundspring of all being.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark370">Cancer is not merely feeling; it is feeling </a><i>part </i>of something. Where Gemini is an intellectual awareness of relationship, Cancer is an emotional awareness, one that can be inchoate, unformulated, and too deep for simple, rational expression. Particularly, Cancer is awareness of relationship to the past: one’s childhood, family (especially mother), community, and even homeland. Cancer is not so much an awareness of one’ relationship to other individuals in general; that is the function of the air signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because Cancerian needs are so fundamental, interference with their fulfillment can have particularly bad effects. Cancer symbolizes the need for</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">emotional security, for feeling that one’s environment will support one’s existence, and for feeling nurtured by those around one. If these aspects of the energy work properly, Cancer also symbolizes the need to support and nurture others, giving to others what one oneself has already received. But if the needs of Cancer are not fulfilled, one often becomes caught in infantile patterns of behavior: behavior that is grasping and emotionally possessive from fear of losing those that are loved. The love one gives may be smothering. Also, material possessions may become symbols of emotional security; those with Cancerian problems may surround themselves with things in an effort to get from physical objects the emotional support they really need. The traits that have sometimes given Cancer a bad reputation are not intrinsic to the sign; they result from vital needs not being gratified.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the plus side, Cancer symbolizes patterns that are essential to the social good. In every group there must be those who support others, nurture them, take care of the needy, and reassure the insecure. If Cancer did not manifest, everything would be purely functional, rational, cold, and dead. In fact, today’s breakup of the family and increasing reliance on the state for the care of the young, the old, and the infirm represents a trend toward the destruction of those Cancerian elements necessary for social cohesion. Cancer’s needs for roots and community conflict with Gemini’s needs for getting around, having experience, and being free—needs that are dominant in our culture now. It should be noted that, astrologically speaking, Gemini is a more primitive function in the development of the individual than is Cancer.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Cancer to the Moon <span class="p">This is another close sign-ruler relationship. Along with the Moon and the fourth house, Cancer is part of the mother complex of symbols. Both the sign and the planet relate to nurture, to the feeling of belonging, to the idea of coming from somewhere and from something. Cancer and the Moon are strongly concerned with emotional security, and both can be infantile in the way they express their needs when thwarted, especially if emotional security is lacking early in life.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark371">The principal difference is that the Moon is a planet and Cancer is a sign. Also, the Moon is one of the bodies that affects the individual chart most strongly, whereas Cancer is part of a set of general relationships that may or may not strongly affect an individual. For example, having Saturn in Cancer indicates one is born in a period of general weakness of the nurturing principle, but having Saturn conjunct the Moon is a strong, personal statement concerning an individual’s experience of nurture.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Cancer on Planets <span class="p">Cancer is at its best with strongly emotional planets like the Moon, Venus, and possibly Neptune and Pluto (although Pluto in combination with the maternal group of symbols can be so intense as to signify difficulties). Jupiter is favored in Cancer not so much because of its emotional quality as because it shares with Cancer a protective feeling and the desire to support those who are still growing.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Airy planets such as Mercury and Uranus have a harder time in Cancer: water, which is personal and subjective, interferes with the clear mental observation and detached judgment of air.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The strong ego energies of Mars often have difficulty in Cancerian areas of experience (such as one’s relationship to home, mother, and family) that ought to be relatively free of ego tension. Similarly, Saturn is difficult in Cancer because it creates barriers in these same areas, areas that ought to be among the few in which emotional energies can flow freely without obstacles. One should not have to feel the need to perform to a high standard in order to be accepted by one’s family. In one’s family one should not have to feel that one is constantly being judged and required by others to be what one is not. Saturn in Cancer may accompany this kind of problem, but the lengthy time Saturn stays in a sign usually makes its effects general rather than personal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part89.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part91.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
