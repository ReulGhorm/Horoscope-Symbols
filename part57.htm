The 360° dial chart is useful for gaining an overview and for seeing all the direct midpoints. By checking the axes in square and semisquare to the direct axis, you can also find indirect midpoints; in fact it is possible to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">165</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">do midpoint work using only the 360° dial.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark253">The 90° dial, however, saves even more labor and quadruples the accuracy possible with a dial. In the 90° dial chart all conjunctions, squares, and oppositions look like conjunctions, and all semisquares and sesquiquadrates look like oppositions. Therefore all hard aspects are immediately visible along a single axis. The 90° dial is especially suited to an approach that uses only hard aspects and treats them all alike. The only disadvantage is that you cannot distinguish squares and oppositions from conjunctions, or direct midpoints from indirect ones, without writing the sign of each planet in on the 90° chart or looking back at the 360° chart.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using a 360° dial with a perfectly centered hole and accurate degree markings, you can get accuracy up to about a quarter of a degree; with a well-made 90° dial you can get accuracy to five minutes of arc or better. In the relatively rare cases where you need better accuracy (such as in checking an orb or timing a transit) you can calculate one or a few midpoints by hand or use a computer-calculated midpoint listing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part56.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part58.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
