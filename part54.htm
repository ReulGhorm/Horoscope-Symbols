For example, trines between a midpoint and another factor would not be considered. The early writings of these schools implied that trines, sextiles, and other three-series aspects are not effective, but more recently this position has been modified. I once used aspects not of the two-series routinely in midpoint work, and they were quite effective. Despite this, my standard practice and that of both the Uranians and Cosmobiologists is now to use only hard aspects in midpoint work.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The reasons are mainly practical. Using only hard aspects simplifies things, in that there is only one quality of aspect to color all midpoint combinations. The hard aspects (see pages 122-127) differ from each other, to be sure, but even so, their similarities are greater than their differences. This is because division by two, unlike division by three or any other whole number, creates octaves. In music, the higher tone in an octave has exactly half the wavelength as the lower, but to the ear it sounds nearly the same. If</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">two people sing the same melody at the same time an octave apart, there is not only no dissonance, there is little awareness that two sets of notes are being sung. Similarly, the two-series aspects have virtually the same quality as the conjunction, as they merely halve, quarter, etc., the arc length in the same way wavelengths are divided to produce octaves in music.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">By contrast, notes related as the trine and all other three-series aspects are to the conjunction are quite different in sound from the original note. In the musical fifth, which corresponds to the trine, the higher note has one-third the wavelength of the original tone. Thus the trine (or any other aspect not of the two-series) introduces additional qualities into the combination of planets, complicating an already complicated situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The midpoints tied to a planet or other point by hard aspect will tell a great deal about the condition of a planet in a chart. I do not believe that soft-aspect combinations can be used in exactly this way. It has not been my experience that anything is lost by using only the hard aspects among the midpoints, as long as one gets over the traditional and not very well- founded idea that all hard aspects are “bad.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part53.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part55.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
