Jupiter has been called the greater benefic (Venus being the lesser), and it has always been considered the sign of positive results in every endeavor.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">More recently, there has been a reaction against the old view, and the feeling has grown that Jupiter is overrated. Now there is talk of its tendency toward excess, arrogance, waste, and sloppiness. Nevertheless, people usually enjoy the energies of Jupiter, and in most cases it is a genuinely constructive influence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Neither view of Jupiter gets to the heart of the matter, however. It is not enough to know that Jupiter can bring about one thing or another, or that people feel good or not good in reaction to its energies. The question is, what <i>are </i>Jupiter’s energies?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter, in my experience, relates to two apparently different but closely related sets of energies: the energy of expansion and the energy of integration. We will take up both of these in turn and show how one or the other or both lead to the ideas that people have had about Jupiter. More importantly, we shall come to a clearer understanding of the role Jupiter plays in our lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark95">First of all, what do we mean by expansion? Expansion of what? As all planets are fundamentally psychological in action, Jupiter is that energy which expands something in the psyche. Specifically, Jupiter symbolizes the energy that expands the sphere of action and experience in which the individual lives and moves.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each person is born into a relatively narrow range of action and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">experience. In the beginning, one’s world is the crib and its immediate environs, one’s immediate family and their friends. This is not a problem for the individual as long as there is a sense of being at one with the world. Newborn children are probably not aware that they are distinct persons, separate from their mother and environment. Experience soon shows them, however, that they are separate, and that they have little control over the environment or the people in it. This dawning awareness of separation and lack of control must inevitably lead to a desire to expand one’s world, go out into it, and make it a part of oneself again.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, in its earliest form, Jupiter represents the reaching out of people to reincorporate as much of the external world as possible into themselves, possibly in order to re-create the feeling of oneness felt in the earliest period of life. This includes the desire and need to grow both physically and psychologically.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The initial stages of the Jupiter energy, then, consist of the individual growing on a physical level, going out into the world and learning about it, gaining control and autonomy, and increasing the scope of his or her action and experience. This is the facet of Jupiter that gives it its association with consciousness expansion, learning, the desire for travel, the love of freedom and independence. It is also the side of Jupiter that gives rise to its association with excessive growth, waste, and sloppiness. In the desire to grow, the need to handle details and deal with the minor aspects of living tends to get overlooked or deemed unworthy of one’s attention.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter is associated with incorporation, the bringing of entities external to one’s self into one’s world and making them part of the self. There is a strong connection between the Moon and Jupiter in this regard. On the physiological level, for example, both are associated with digestion. Jupiter is usually regarded as the energy leading to obesity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is yet another connection between the Moon and Jupiter. Both are part of the support system needed in growing up. The Moon, as we have pointed out, relates to nurture and the creation of an individual’s sense of emotional well-being. Whereas the Moon is part of the mother complex of symbols, Jupiter is more connected with the father complex. It is the part of parenting where the parents give the child encouragement and support in its efforts to grow and expand its world. For every challenge with which the child is presented in its education, there should be a corresponding encouragement that allows the child to believe that it can learn to overcome the challenge. This is an aspect of Jupiter as the planet of growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark96">In strongly Jupiterian people, the growth aspect of this planet can lead down either of two paths. One type of Jupiterian personality may live</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">life reaching out to comprehend and experience as much of the universe as possible. This type is interested in all kinds of learning, knowledge, and experience. Breadth of experience prevents this person from taking narrow- minded positions based on short-term goals at the expense of long-range objectives. Knowing that the self’s own interests are best furthered by furthering those of the greater world of which one is a part and of which one has seen and experienced so much, such a person usually has a strong sense of social consciousness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The other type of Jupiterian personality manifests the lunar side of Jupiter and cannot let go of what is seen and experienced. This person tries to own everything and to become more important than anyone, more grand and more arrogant. This type is never satisfied with anything gotten in life and is always on the move.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What is the difference between these two types? I believe it lies in other energies that have to do with the security of the ego. Both types are restless and always on the move, but one is never happy and the other usually is.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is always a limit to growth, and that limit is imposed by two factors. One is that every entity has a certain built-in capacity for growth, and when that capacity is exceeded, growth stops. The other factor is that the external world can only support so much growth. There is a limit, for example, to food and resources. Room is also needed for growth because no one entity can grow beyond a certain point without trespassing upon others’ rights. Whatever the source, the limit is imposed by the energy of Saturn, as we shall see in the next section.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter as the energy of integration arises from encountering the limits of Saturn. Put simply, if the extent to which one can grow, absorb the external universe, and make it one’s own is limited, then maybe there is another way to overcome one’s littleness, one’s feeling of isolation and lack of control. One can integrate oneself into the prevailing social order. This allows one to connect with others by becoming part of them. If one cannot control the social order around oneself, maybe one can represent what it stands for.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This integrative side of Jupiter is also connected with the father complex of symbols. It is the function of the father symbols not only to cause one to grow through constant challenges and to provide support to help one meet those challenges, but also to assist one in finding a place in the world, a role to play, a sphere in which one can be effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark97">The integrative side of Jupiter expresses itself most typically in its association with religion. Religion is (at least one hopes) a consciousness-</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">expanding system. But even more, it is a system for giving one a relationship to the universe. The most common etymology of the word “religion” is that it comes from the Latin <i>religere</i>, “to bind back”—that is, to bind oneself back to the universe. Religion is a powerful device for attempting to overcome one’s feeling of separateness. Jupiterian religion is not the religion of the ascetic alone on a mountain top, however, but rather the religion of elaborate social rituals in which all may play a part. It is the religion of the priest rather than the mystic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter’s connection with the law is also a function of its integrative side. Insofar as the law is a set of rules and restrictions, it is Saturnine, but insofar as it is the fabric of formal agreements that bind a society together, it is Jupiterian. Jupiter also rules the informal, implicit agreements by which we get along as a society.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Jupiter has also been associated with medicine and healing, the reintegration of the body after illness or prevention of bodily disintegration. The desire of the mind for the grand overview also stems from the integrative side of Jupiter. The Jupiterian mind is more interested in seeing how everything relates to everything else than it is in examining any one thing in detail. Details are simply not as important to the Jupiterian as the understanding of what it is that integrates things. From this we get the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiterian’s love of philosophy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Just as an aggressive personal overexpansiveness can lead to arrogance, so, too, can overidentifying with that with which one feels integrated. One may feel, for example, that as a representative of the social order, one has the right to act as if one were its embodiment. Here we get a colossal arrogance, such as can be seen clearly in the chart of Adolf Hitler with his Moon conjunct Jupiter. This aspect is usually positive, but in Hitler’s case it shows the power of Jupiter perverted.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most people like to grow. Most like to feel a part of something greater than themselves. Most enjoy having increased opportunities in life. As a result, most enjoy Jupiter. But this is not the result of Jupiter’s being <i>inherently </i>good. Jupiter seems to get along with more different planetary energies than most other planets, yet it is not unusual for its energies to work out badly. Unlimited growth may leave no room for further growth. Too many available resources can lead one to waste what one has. And the waste, in turn, as is all too clear at this point in history, can become a barrier to further growth. At the same time, every organism must grow and must have a place in the scheme of things. All of this is Jupiterian.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part26.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part28.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
