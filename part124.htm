One is the aspect relation the houses have to each other. I have already touched on the way a house can derive at least a part of its meaning from its position in relation to other houses. In the first half of this chapter I will discuss both what I feel is an abuse of deriving house meanings in this way and what I feel is its proper use.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The more important source of house meanings is probably the relation of the houses to the horizon and meridian circles. I will close this chapter with a demonstration of how house meanings become clearer when we see them growing out of a clockwise progress between these fundamental divisions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part125.htm">Derived House Meanings: Their Use and Abuse</a><a class="toc0" href="part126.htm">The Case for Clockwise Houses</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part123.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part125.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
