In part, this may be because it is not often an obvious source of difficulty to people. Also, I suspect, people find its symbolism less exciting than that of some other planets. Yet it is a symbol of immense importance. It is connected to the mind, especially the logical and reasoning capabilities, and to all forms of communication. Likewise, Mercury (along with Uranus) signifies the nervous system, because the nerves enable the organs to communicate among themselves. In the world, Mercury is connected to all forms of transportation and movement. But, important as these traditional ascriptions are, they do not make the real importance of the planet clear.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury’s importance comes from two sources. The first lies in the function Mercury serves, and the second in the mechanism by which the symbolism operates.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury signifies the power to overcome the gap that exists between separate entities. The world as seen in normal human consciousness is a world of divisions. The first of these is the division between subject and object, I and Thou. I cannot experience what you experience and you cannot experience what I experience. We can never fully occupy another’s point of view, yet we are not wholly cut off. We can communicate, and communication is one of the chief Mercurial functions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As we grow out of the infantile state of consciousness in which everything appears more or less one, we become aware that we are separate from the universe around us. At the same time, we gain the ability to speak, to share what we know and experience, and also to allow others to do so with us. This faculty is peculiarly human. With it, we can hand culture down from generation to generation, without having to wait for nature to create new kinds of programed behavior through instinct, which develops very slowly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In this way, Mercury is an aspect of consciousness itself: it creates the relationship between subject and object that is necessary in order for consciousness to exist. The child begins to speak (a Mercurial function) just at the time that its consciousness is beginning to grasp the fact that people are indeed separate from one another, in particular the child from the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mother. Also, it is about this time, usually sooner, that the child begins learning to walk, which is another Mercurial function. In learning physically to move through our surroundings we are also learning how to overcome the gaps between ourselves and others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The second source of Mercury’s importance is that it represents the power of symbol-making. By extension, this includes all forms of data transfer.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All our knowing, experiencing, sensing, believing, or disbelieving is done through signs which represent actual facts, experiences, or entities in our minds. For example, our visual impression of a tree is not the thing itself. It is the brain’s experience of the impact of a pattern of light waves focused on the retina of the eye. What we see as a tree is only our experience of an aspect of the total reality of the tree. All other sense impressions are also patterns of this kind created by the brain’s receiving data from the sense organs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One remarkable fact about nerve impulses is that in general they are identical. What varies is the portion of the brain that receives each set of impulses. Thus it is the brain that creates sensory experiences such as sights, smells, sounds, tastes, textures, and the like. In this way we are quite literally the creators of our own experience. Every sense experience is a brain-created sign that corresponds (at least most of the time) to a physical reality.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We habitually identify our sense experiences with the physical universe, such that we cannot even conceive of the physical universe apart from the signs created by the brain to represent it. Modern physics is difficult to grasp precisely because it requires that we go beyond the sign systems of the brain in order to deal with what the science has shown us. What the brain perceives has a reliable but not inevitable correspondence with reality. You can create the experience of light in total darkness: simply press gently for a time on your closed eyelids, and you will see light. No electromagnetic radiation is involved. It does not matter what is stimulating the optic nerves: as long as something is stimulating them, the optic centers of the brain will interpret it as light.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We make the brain’s signs for experiences stand for the physical reality. Experience of the outer world, no matter how profound, consists only of such signs: the outer world itself is beyond being directly experienced. But, using the signs for experiences, we create complex systems, mental maps that we call reality. If our map enables us to interact with the universe effectively, we act “realistically.” If our map does not, we are victims of illusion.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We are assisted in this process by memory, which enables us to call up the signs of experiences at will. And memory is assisted by another tool, language. Language consists of signs of signs. If we call the signs created directly from experience primary signs, then language consists of secondary, tertiary, and even higher orders of signs. We translate the primary signs of experience into higher-order signs of language which have the virtue of being able to be written down. In preliterate societies, the same function was served by poetry (with the rhythm, rhyme, and meter serving to assist the memory).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Language also allows us to close the gap between us and others—to transmit to another some understanding of our personal map of reality. Something is always lost in translation, of course, because the primary signs of experience are much more powerful than the higher-order signs of language. This is one reason we have created something more powerful than verbal language—something that can carry more of the immediate power of primary signs. This is art in all its forms. While not as precise as verbal language for some purposes, art is much more powerful in conveying certain kinds of experience. Insofar as art is communication, it is signified by Mercury (though the act of creation is Venusian).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The translation of immediate experience into language does not proceed on a one-to-one basis. Not only must the experiences themselves be translated into language, the relationships among those experiences must also be translated. The language itself must contain rules for doing this, and such rules do not arise directly out of experience. Thus language, both in speech and thought, gains in the mind a life of its own, apart from experience. Concepts arise which are not directly derived from experience, but they help form our memories of experience, and may in turn influence later experiences. And we create even higher-level concepts that stand for groups of concepts and experiences.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It happens, then, that we constantly have to translate ideas and signs from one level to another, creating several different maps of reality according to whether we are thinking, speaking, imagining, or simply having an experience directly. The mind must be able to shift quickly from one level of signs to another, and ideally it must be able to communicate to others as well. In this way intelligence is like physical dexterity, which is also Mercurial. Both relate to speedy and efficient manipulations which may or may not have to do with a meaningful context.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark87">Creating maps or sets of signs that correspond either to reality or to other groups of signs is a Mercurial function. And very often the signs by which things are represented may be found operating in several different</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">media simultaneously. It is obvious that written and spoken language are closely parallel sign systems. But it is not so obvious that radio waves modified so as to communicate sound and video images also constitute a set of signs which can parallel language.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The conversion is done by a process known as modulation. Anything that is modified from its normal state so it can be used as a medium for data transmission can be thought of as modulated. Devices that translate data from one medium to another are known in languages as translators, and in mechanical terms as transducers. Translation and transduction are important functions of Mercury. Spoken language is a translation of experience into sound waves, and written language a translation of experience into visual patterns, while a tape recording system transduces sounds into magnetic patterns and back again.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury is neither the maps themselves, nor the languages, nor the mechanical media in which data is stored, nor is it any of the representational signs themselves. It is the <i>process </i>of creating the maps or the languages, of storing the data or the signs, and of making sure that maps created in one medium correspond to the original set of experiences, ideas, or signs that the map represents.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury manifests in the action of the nerves, which are the physical channels by which these processes are carried out in the body, and in the action of the brain, where the mapmaking takes place. (Actually, the brain is related to several different planetary energies. It is solar in that it governs the body, lunar in that it is a seat of feelings and behavior patterns, and it is related in various ways to the other planets as well.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Intelligence is the ability to handle all the functions and processes we ascribe to Mercury. People of higher intelligence are better able to handle several levels of abstraction in the signs by which the brain works, and are better able to make translations from one sign system to another.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Consciousness, on the other hand, is different from intelligence. Consciousness is related to wisdom, in that both have to do with keeping the mind clear about how far removed from direct experience a set of signs may be. People who are intelligent but not wise or conscious may confuse high- level concepts with the things they represent and allow the structure of their concepts to modify the way they deal with truth. The wise person always keeps in mind that concepts are no more than representations and that they are somewhat arbitrary representations at that. One can be relatively low in intelligence and still be wise. The symbol-making processes of the wise are less likely to get in the way of their experiencing.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mercury is connected with travel because travel is a means by</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">which one fills in the details of one’s map of reality. Mercury signifies travel of the routine, day-to-day variety, however, not long journeys, which are discontinuous with normal experience and hence expand the mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark88">Mercury has also been associated with youth, but I do not believe that this is intrinsic to the symbol. The association probably arises because Mercury has its strongest effects during early life, when basic mental patterns are set, and thus remains connected in the mind with youth. From this, Mercury also derives its androgynous, presexual quality.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury’s nature often produces restlessness, an appetite for input. Mercurial energies can cause the mind to try to move on to a new experience before it has digested and integrated an old one. Thus people of a Mercurial nature run the danger of being superficial learners unless they discipline themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury also tends to be concerned with details. This comes from its function of putting many signs together into maps which must be as clear as possible. Consequently, the details of the signs themselves must also be very clear. Sometimes this habit can turn into nitpicking, in which the concern for details replaces the concern for actual experience. This side of Mercury is most associated with Virgo. A Mercurial person can also become more concerned with the elegance of an idea than its usefulness. This side of Mercury is more of the nature of Gemini.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the highest level, Mercury is associated with the Logos or Word, the aspect of divinity in which the will of God is translated into the particular forms and structures of the created universe. Occultists have always considered the physical universe itself to be nothing more than a set of signs or a map corresponding to the divine nature. All knowledge and wisdom come through the Logos, whose planetary symbol is Mercury. Thus, as long as the process of knowing is recognized to be less important than that which is to be known, Mercury is one of the highest symbols of all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part23.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part25.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
