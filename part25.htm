One is coercive, trying to bring elements together regardless of their individual natures or inclinations. Such a force, working from without, does not express the natures of the elements themselves. It creates a conflict when the intrinsic natures of the elements involved resist the energy of coercion from without. The external force must be maintained, or the elements forced together will break apart and try to resume the free expression of what they</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are. Depending on conditions, such a coercive force may be represented by various combinations of Mars, Saturn, and Pluto.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The second force works differently. It arises from <i>within </i>the entities that bond together as an expression of their intrinsic natures rather than a violation of them. In anthropomorphic terms, the union is voluntary, not involuntary. The entities come together because their differences are complementary. Together they can create a new whole that is higher—more perfect, complete, and stable—than the state of separation in which they previously existed. This is the power that is manifested in the bonding of subatomic particles into atoms, of atoms into molecules, molecules into molecular complexes, cells, organisms, and so forth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although the essence of this non-coercive bonding energy is constant at all levels of being, the particular manifestations are different. At one level it might be called electrostatic attraction, at another, molecular binding energy, or at another, gravitation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In human beings, this force is experienced as love. Of all the forces that bind people together, love produces the most stable groupings. I am not referring to romantic love between the sexes, which is a temporary narcotic state produced by people projecting onto others the creations of their own minds. I mean being fond of people, liking them for what they really are. The unions produced by love are stable because such relationships allow people to express what they are, better than they could if the union were absent. This kind of voluntary union holds people together more tightly than any union based on coercion or even on mutual benefit.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Venus is the planetary significator of this second type of binding force in general, and of love in particular. Venus also signifies beauty and creation. Beauty arises when a set of relationships between different entities allows them to express themselves more completely, to be more perfectly themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Creation is the act of combining separate elements to form a more nearly perfect whole, often revealing facets that were not apparent when the entities were separate. An artist is one who sees these potentials and is able to actualize them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One should not confuse “beautiful” with “pretty” even though the beautiful is often also pretty. Much beautiful art is also grotesque—the gargoyles on medieval cathedrals, for example. Truly beautiful art, however, always expresses a truth that was not apparent before, and this is what makes it beautiful. Keats’s line, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” is literally true.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wherever Venus operates, one can clearly see the harmony produced</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">by something moving in accordance with nature and itself. In its highest manifestations Venus always expresses a beauty that is not only aesthetic but also somehow functional. That function can be something like making people more aware of themselves and more in tune with their world. The materialist is not wrong when he demands that everything must justify its existence by being useful; he is only wrong in giving the word “useful” too narrow a meaning. Giving people a sense of harmony in their world is just as useful as making sure they have material resources.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark90">All Venusian forces are experienced as spontaneous attractions. For this reason, Venus is often associated with attraction itself. But Venus only rules spontaneous, self-expressive attractions, in which neither entity has to violate its nature in order to be involved.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Venus and Mars, the next planet to be discussed, operate as a polarity. Whereas Venus is a planet of merging, Mars helps one establish one’s separate identity. Unless you have established yourself as an individual, Venus cannot operate properly in your life. You have to express yourself, be what you really are, before you can love or be truly loved. If love is an attraction that comes about through true self-expression, there must first be an individuality to express. Those who have given up their individuality in what they think is a love relationship often wonder why the partner loses interest in them. It is hard to love someone whose individuality has been submerged, even if it has been submerged into oneself. Many who fail at positive love relationships do so because they lack faith in their own individuality. Even people who do have relationships will often compromise their needs in order to get along with the other. Then their real nature comes into conflict with the role that they have taken on, and the relationship becomes strained. At some point, the relationship will either have to be adjusted to let the real individuality of the partners come out, or it will end.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The symbolism of Venus is particularly important to astrology as a study of human individuality that strives to get people in touch with their own true selves. A well-developed Venus energy is essential in any type of counselor, because the client-counselor relationship must not only express the natures of both individuals, it must also allow both to develop themselves and their self-expression more completely. Any relationship that causes people to become more fully realized is Venusian.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It has been often said that as a molecule is composed of atoms, and the body of cells and tissues, so society is composed of individuals. Indeed, that is implicit in what we have been saying. Some claim, however, that society is the next level of organic evolution, and use this to justify</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">totalitarian systems which repress individual liberty. According to this thinking, the individual is less important than the state and must live to serve it. I hope it is clear that this is not really a manifestation of Venus energies, and also that this does not truly represent the kind of evolutionary energy found in nature. A state that demands far more from the individual than it gives is a manifestation of the first, or coercive, kind of energy discussed earlier, which relies on external force to maintain itself. Such a state must eventually disintegrate, as all such states have done. No state has ever come close to fulfilling the ideal of a creative union of fully individualized beings coming together for mutual fulfillment and gratification. The state is in no way a forward step in biological evolution: something new must come along.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark91">Before we conclude our discussion of Venus, there is another important point that follows from the idea of Venus as love. Venus is also associated with nurturing mother-love in particular. Together with the Moon, Venus forms the planetary part of the mother complex of symbols. Because of the self-expressive aspect of Venus, it is not necessary for someone to be anything in particular in order to be loved. I do not love you because you do this and that; I love you simply because you exist and I exist and it is in my nature to love what you are. The most profound example of this, and the example that provides the basis for our giving and experiencing love later in life, is the experience of being loved by one’s parents, especially ones mother (but this is by no means restricted solely to the female parent).</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Venus is like the Moon in that it is not overly concerned about distinctions and details. It gives what it gives freely and without worrying as to whether it is appropriate or whether the object of one’s affections is worth it. This should be fairly obvious from looking at the kinds of people with whom other people fall in love.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Venus has become too closely associated with Taurus, one of the signs it traditionally rules. Because of this, many modern commentators have begun to overlook the connection between Venus and love and have begun to see Venus only as the planetary manifestation of the negative side of Taurus. They see Venus as passive, excessively fond of luxury and comfort, and unwilling to exert itself. There is some basis for this in that Venus, being a yin energy, is not especially assertive, and in that it attracts things to you rather than going out after something you want. Also, Venus’s love of the beautiful can work out to be a fondness for the cheap and flashy. This is not intrinsic to Venus, however; it is a perverted manifestation caused by interference from other planetary energies or from inharmonious sign placement. Although there is clearly some affinity between Venus and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Taurus, I am not entirely sure that Venus “rules” Taurus. One should not simply assume that Venus and Taurus are identical. Taurus is much more earthy and less watery than Venus. (For a discussion of the meanings of the elements, see pages 184-196.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, Venusian people are warm and loving as well as socially adept. They enjoy being with their loved ones and are often at a disadvantage when alone. More than any other planetary type, the Venus type recognizes the power that being with a loved one gives one to cope with life creatively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part24.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part26.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
