They usually represent an instability within the personality that must be worked on if it is to come out positively. One cannot sit still on top of hard- aspect energies: they demand action and change. Because they often manifest in events, hard aspects are easier to understand than the less eventful three-series aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A particularly good metaphor for the effects of two-series versus</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">three-series aspects has been put forth by Mario Jones, M.D., of Cleveland, Ohio. His research in medical astrology suggests that two-series aspects are no more apt to signify illness than three-series aspects, but they indicate different kinds of disorders. According to Jones, two-series aspects coincide with the onset of acute illness, which arises suddenly at a definite point in time and has a clearly defined critical phase. Three-series aspects coincide with chronic illness, which arises slowly and persists over long periods with no definite crisis. This fits with the psychological correlates of these aspects, in which two-series aspects indicate events that come at a particular point in time, have a clearly defined crisis, and then depart, while three-series aspects indicate ongoing states of being.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traditionally, two-series aspects have been considered malefic. Even when hard aspects combined planets that we consider favorable, astrologers of the past treated them as a source of danger. To some extent, modern astrologers go to the other extreme by regarding hard aspects as sources of usually constructive tension that cause the personality to grow. This is true and is in fact a good way of looking at two-series aspects, but it does not recognize their inherently difficult nature under certain circumstances. The truth is, as is so often the case, somewhere between the extremes. Insofar as the two-series aspects represent energy patterns that are unstable and demand change, they produce difficulties whenever the individual either refuses to allow the changes to take place, or is in a situation where the changes cannot readily take place. These aspects are often relentless in their drive toward change and disruption, and it is extremely important for these energies to be given room to express themselves. It is not simply a matter of releasing the energies so that they cannot do harm; if properly released, these energies are the only real means by which any kind of creative change can come about. People whose charts consist mostly of two-series aspects have chosen in this lifetime to take a path of evolution in which the risks as well as the rewards are great. Those who do not have this emphasis, or who have primarily three-series aspects, have chosen a more secure path, one with fewer risks, but also fewer rewards.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Those who have chosen the two-series path and succeeded in it may or may not be significant in the world at large. Nevertheless, they have mastered important psychological and spiritual lessons, and in their presence one has a sense of their power and energy. We often describe such people as “wise.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Those having this kind of chart, but who do not master the energy, however, are often among the worst losers in life and appear to be victims</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of every conceivable misfortune. Happily, such extreme cases are rare. Interestingly, the charts of the most successful and talented are often similar to those of the most unsuccessful and unproductive: charts with many two- series aspects signify a make-or-break situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As with the conjunction, with two-series aspects it makes a difference what planets are linked together. Some combinations are more difficult than others, either because the planets themselves possess energies that are intrinsically in conflict, or because they indicate energy patterns whose manifestation flies in the face of social convention. Certain planetary combinations may be more difficult to handle in some eras than in others. For example, in Victorian times, aspects in a woman’s chart that indicated an urgent need for sexual expression would obviously be much more malefic than the same aspects now.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark208">Opposition (180°) </a><span class="p">The symbolism of the opposition aspect is very much what one would expect: polarity, strife, conflict, and so on, but also partnership and cooperation, as well as consciousness itself. The opposition can be compared in its effects to the seventh house of the mundane sphere, which derives its meanings from the fact that it is in opposition to the first house.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whatever energies are linked by the opposition, they are combined in such a way that they produce instability and change through conflict. If one examines the conflict, it is seen to arise between an aspect of oneself that has been projected outward and an aspect of oneself that is experienced inwardly. Put more concretely, the opposition signifies a conflict between an external factor and an internal one, and the external factor is the result of an inward energy that one does not as yet understand to be within the self.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">For example, many who have the Sun in opposition to Uranus continually encounter others who create disruptions in their lives. It is easy for them to see themselves as victims of these other disruptive people, but on a closer look one can usually discern how the first party creates the inevitability of the confrontation with the second. The confrontation is brought about by an aspect of the self that has not been given adequate expression, and is now struggling to break free through the assistance of another person. Some people with this aspect will work in the reverse manner and try to revolutionize the lives of others by confronting them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It should be clear, especially in the case of the individual who finds others disruptive, that the disruptive person, entity, or situation is being used by the individual’s subconscious as a mirror to confront an aspect of himself which he then tries to make conscious. Thus the opposition aspect has, through such confrontation, the potential to increase the level of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">130</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">consciousness. This aspect usually works well only for those who are willing to grant space in their lives to the energies in the opposition that challenge them. Many people will not allow themselves to realize that they are instrumental in bringing about every confrontation in which they become involved, and that there is in every confrontation something of oneself that must be made conscious and accepted as one’s own. Thus they continue to fight the battle signified by the opposition, making no progress and suffering much pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">With an opposition, the goal is to recognize that both (or all, as the case may be) of the planetary energies are one’s own, and that they must be allowed to dominate, or one will come once again to be victimized by an apparently outward force embodying the energy that one did not allow to express itself. The goal is a state of perfect equilibrium between the two energies involved in the opposition: it represents the aspect’s partnership and cooperation side.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark209">Achieving equilibrium is not equally easy with all oppositions. Some, where the energies of the planets involved are very contradictory, are harder than others to resolve. These are the oppositions traditionally considered malefic, such as Moon-Saturn, Saturn-Neptune, and Mars- Neptune. Sometimes a life will revolve entirely around balancing such energies. Nevertheless, the energy and growth in consciousness to be gained by successfully resolving an opposition is immense. The opposition aspect is an excellent example of the make-or-break quality possessed in varying degrees by the two-series. It is the most powerful aspect after the conjunction, and it is a very close second. Many astrologers consider it less powerful than the square, but this is not my experience. The square may simply claim more attention because it represents issues that are less easily resolved, possibly because the conflict itself is harder to define.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Square (90°) </b>The square is the <i>bete noire </i>of many astrologers. Even some who are otherwise positive in their thinking speak of this aspect with trepidation. As with the opposition, energies linked by square are tremendously dynamic, and squares are significators of change. The two energies are in conflict, but, unlike the opposition, it is not a head-on conflict. It seems as if energies linked by square get in each others’ way not by going in opposite directions but by working at cross purposes. The goals of the energies are different, not opposite, such that to achieve one goal takes away from achieving the other. In many ways, the square is a test of the validity of some kind of statement that your life has made, or even of your entire life itself. It is not a test that you have to fail, however. You simply are forced through a square to prove yourself. As with the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">131</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">opposition, the square gives tremendous energy when it is resolved.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Resistance <span class="p">is an important key idea with the square. Resistance is a cosmic principle that we know in its purest form as matter. The fundamental law of matter is that two material objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time: when someone tries to make them do so, they resist each other. The entire material universe can be viewed as a collection of resistances by which a life is limited in its freedom and is forced to take on a definite form. The alert reader will no doubt notice the similarity of this idea to the idea of Saturn. The resemblance is no accident, in that Saturn is the planet of material reality, and the square is the aspect of material reality. Whereas the first step in creating the universe is to become conscious of the not-self (the opposition), the second step is to create the resistances in the universe that we call matter (the square). Thus two or more planets linked by a square represent energies that resist each other and force each other to take on a definite form of behavior. While they limit each other in some way, they also greatly increase each other’s individuality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark210">The problem is that, whereas with the opposition there was usually one energy that seemed external while the other seemed to be coming from within the self, with the square a person may have inner-inner, inner-outer, or outer-outer conflict. It may be, for example, that there are two energies within oneself, neither of which is well understood, that are in conflict with each other; and the conflict goes on simply because one is aware only of the tension, not the sources of the tension. No matter which form the square takes, it is usually difficult to see exactly how the energies are connected and in conflict.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The most important characteristic of the square is that whatever dilemma it may pose, trying to fight the effects of the square by repressing its energies and expressing only the energies that one can accept merely results in the same problem emerging over and over again. Only by going along with the changes that the conflicts lead toward can one bring the energies into some degree of harmony. Even working at its best, however, the square creates ongoing change. This can be progress, if one allows it, but the square can never reach a point of stability. If one thinks of the square as resistance, as matter resisting pressure, then it becomes clear that the only way to deal with a square is to move in accordance with limitations imposed by the universe, not to try to go through the resistance any more than one would try to walk through a wall rather than using the door.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Semisquare (45°) and Sesquiquadrate (135°) <span class="p">The semisquare and sesquiquadrate are taken together because they are both based on the division of the circle by the number eight. (In fact, some people call them</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">132</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the octile and trioctile.) It may very well be true that each represents a slightly different mode of linking energies, but at this point any differences between them seem too slight to be worth noting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">These are not weak aspects. An exact semisquare or sesquiquadrate is more important than a square that is several degrees out, and many traditional astrologers who have ignored these so-called minor aspects have missed out on important information.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Both the semisquare and sesquiquadrate are of the newer family of aspects discovered in the seventeenth century by Johannes Kepler. They were not recognized by Ptolemy, but then if one reads Ptolemy carefully, it is quite clear that his use of aspects in general was quite different from ours. He seems to have measured aspects simply from sign to sign: that is, for two planets to be in square, they simply had to be in signs that were 90° from each other. This could make a square of as little as 61°, if one planet were in the very beginning of a sign and the other were in the very end. Such a method, similar to that employed by modern Hindu astrologers, would obscure the semisquare and the sesquiquadrate completely. In the modern method of dividing the circle by small integers, however, the semisquare and the sesquiquadrate follow logically from the square. In fact, many astrologers, including this author, have even gone one step further and divided the 45° unit by two, using all aspects based on multiples of 22.5° as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark211">The precise nature of these aspects is hard to pin down. They share all the characteristics of the other two-series aspects in that they represent a dynamic linking between two or more energies that results in instability and change. Studies of the way cycles of transiting planets affect people’s lives have found that these two aspects represent times of crisis similar to the square but usually not as intense. Like the square, they are challenges to some kind of statement made or position taken by the individual, and there are resistances involved. For the present it is operationally useful to consider them to be like squares. Also as with squares, the entities that are introduced into conflict can be inner-inner, inner-outer, or outer-outer. The multiples of 22.5° are usually treated similarly.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part42.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part44.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
