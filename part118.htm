Open enemies, open conflicts, lawsuits.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Counseling relationships<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">That both marriage and open enemies are symbolized by the seventh is a clue to understanding this house. The seventh represents a certain kind of relationship common to both marriage and two persons locked in combat. To truly understand the seventh we have to contrast it to its opposite,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the first house. Both are houses of the self-other relationship, but whereas the first emphasizes the self, the seventh emphasizes the other. In particular, this is the intimate other, with whom the individual forms the kind of close bond that makes two people, insofar as they can be, one.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the first house the self puts energy out into the world; in the seventh the self experiences, as intimately as possible, the world putting energy back into the self. The seventh house is both above the horizon and in the western hemisphere, which makes it a house of experiencing others. This brings us to an important point, already implicit in what we have said, but let us make it explicit.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traditional literature gives the impression that the seventh house describes one’s partner or opponent. But all houses that seem to describe other people are really describing the energies one tends to experience through them, not the objective reality of the people themselves. In fact, the planets in the seventh may describe the energies one puts into as well as receives from intimate relationships. The difference between the seventh and the first is that first-house energies are generally broadcast to the world at large as the individual encounters it, whereas seventh-house energies are put out only into close relationships.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is not possible to say from a natal chart alone whether a person will manifest the energies in the seventh house in terms of <i>action </i>or <i>experience</i>. Most people seem to experience seventh-house energies as other people, but an astrologer cannot safely assume this. This is a situation where the astrologer is better off asking than trying to figure it out.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Something not made clear in many older texts is that not all sides of marriage are signified by the seventh house. Marriage is a complex of energies related to the seventh, coupled with energies that relate to an individual’s sexuality both psychologically and physically. Partnership is closer than marriage to the essential signification of the seventh.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In a seventh-house relationship, two people establish a close dialectic, an interchange in which the two either use each other as reference points against which to define themselves to themselves, or use the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">relationship to create oneness. The first type includes conflict and counseling, the second, partnership and marriage. In both cases the two people feel squared off face-to-face with each other in all their mutual dealings. From this it should be clear that two people engaged in direct competition with each other are also in a seventh-house relationship; hence the significations “open enemies, open conflicts,” and “lawsuits.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The seventh house is distinguished from the eleventh in that the eleventh is principally a house of one-to-many relationships. When it does indicate a friendship, there is no sense of two being one, or two standing face-to-face. If there is this sense, the friendship has become a seventh- house relationship.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In counseling relationships, as with a psychologist or astrologer, one uses another person to help define ones own position. By means of the counselor’s insight, by seeing oneself through the counselor’s eyes, one gets a clearer idea of where one is. Objective self-awareness through intimate encounter with another is an important seventh-house idea. This is symbolized by the seventh and first houses being in an opposition, which is the aspect of confrontation and awareness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The most important facet of the seventh house comes from the nature of relationships themselves. Relationships are opportunities to experience parts of ourselves that we choose not to experience internally. There are two reasons why we might not choose to do this.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Sometimes we fear a certain side of ourselves. Believing it evil or undesirable, we choose to bury it and so it surfaces in our relationships. (More about this in connection with the twelfth house.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The other reason is that the game of life requires that we experience the object as well as the subject. Consciousness requires a dialectic between our inner selves and outer experiences: without something to be conscious of, there can be no consciousness. At the same time, we populate the realm of possible experiences with our own energies, because seeing our own energies external to ourselves as well as being them is a powerful way of getting in touch with what we are. Only when we deny our contribution to so-called “objective” reality do we become victims of what are in fact aspects of ourselves. The seventh house is the most intimate encounter between subject and object. At the highest level, this house is the symbol of the subject-object dichotomy in which the subject and object are actually one.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark473">Internal Level </a><span class="p">On the psychological level, the seventh house symbolizes those aspects of ourselves that manifest whenever the outer world comes in really close to us. As we have shown, the energies of the</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">305</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">seventh may either color our experience of what appears to be external reality, or determine how we react when confronted with real closeness from the apparent other. Using the relationships we set up between ourselves and others, we define ourselves to ourselves. An example is pitting ourselves against another to measure what we can do in comparison with that individual. Even though one usually experiences its energies as coming from other people, the seventh house is almost as important as the first in indicating the nature of one’s own personality.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">On this level the seventh signifies the way we reach out to others to form close interpersonal relationships that link “I” and “thou” into a pair. This is the primary level of the seventh house as a one-to- one encounter. At this level we feel seventh-house energies within the relationship rather than being completely aware that they are ours or experiencing them as if they come from the other person.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At the external level we confuse our experience of the other with the objective reality of the other so that the seventh house seems to describe the nature of one’s marital partner, business partner, enemies, or those against whom one chooses to compete.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Once one gets involved in any kind of seventh-house relationship, one tends to look to the other person as the cause of one’s experience. Many who have had one bad marriage after another blame the whole opposite sex, overlooking the fact that their peers may get along very well in such relationships. The thing to remember is that whatever patterns you experience in intimate relationships over and over again are really telling you about yourself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In a we-they relationship, just as the first house was “we,” the seventh house is “they.” This is only applicable when there is a sense of “we” facing off against “they” directly; that is, “they” must be “you” in the plural sense. Instead of signifying ones personal opponents, the seventh house in this case signifies the opponents of a group with which one identifies.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Seventh House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the seventh indicates someone who feels incomplete alone and strives to fill the void with close partnerships or intimate confrontations. Such people function better in interaction with another. Not necessarily passive or dependent, they can be assertive and take the initiative in forming relationships. They may even encourage others to become dependent on them, thereby maintaining the relationship they need.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark474">To fill the void in their lives, some heavily seventh-house people</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">306</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">pick partners with whom they constantly fight. To them, having a good battle is better than being alone. If other factors in the chart support it, a strong seventh-house individual can be contentious. The seventh is not really a Venusian house, contrary to what is implied by those who equate the seventh, Libra, and Venus. Venus does refer to relationships, but only ones that are loving and warm. The seventh house has no such inherent connection with love.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most planets in the seventh merely signify the kinds of energies experienced through relationships, but Neptune and Saturn can alter the normal style of the seventh house. Neptune may cloud awareness such that one does not get a clearer image of oneself through relationships. The nature of the self-other interaction may be completely unclear. Neptune can also upset the balance between the self and the other. Usually a seventh-house relationship is between equals, but with Neptune here one may feel far above or far below the partner. One may also choose Neptunian people.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Saturn here can symbolize infrequent relationships. This is either because one feels a tremendous gulf between oneself and others, or because one feels overwhelmed by a sense of responsibility toward others in relationships. It is easier not to get involved. Alternatively, the person related to may be Saturnine or one of the partners may be much older than the other.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part117.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part119.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
