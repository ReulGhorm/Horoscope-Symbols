This is clear in that Leo is a sign of developed ego and self-confidence, with strong needs for self-expression, admiration, and uncompromising personal integrity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Many issues that Aries confronted reemerge in Leo, but with important differences. Whereas Aries was a sign of potential vigorously trying to actualize itself, Leo is a sign in which that potential <i>is </i>actualized. For Aries we said, “I want to become what I am;” for Leo we say simply, “I am.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">While Leo represents the entity complete in its basic structure, however, the individual is still socially incomplete. One has yet to deal with one’s relationship to others. One is like the child who has just accomplished</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">something new, and who is not happy until every adult within reach knows about it. Even though every human being in history may have achieved the same thing, for the child, the accomplishment is new and fascinating. This is the basic psychology of the Leo principle (although, of course, most adult Leos are far from being that primitive about it).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, there is a genuine fascination with the self, and a desire that others be similarly fascinated. But only in defective strongly Leonine personalities does this pattern emerge as egotism or show-off behavior. In most adult Leos it comes out as a need for personal recognition, a desire to be impressive, and a need to control one’s destiny. The desire to be impressive is usually a desire to be genuinely so—that is, to be an individual of real significance, not merely to appear significant. Leo, like Aries and for the same reasons, is an honest sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The metaphor for the mature Leo is that of the king or the Sun. Leo desires to be an energy source, one that provides not only for its own accomplishments but also for those of others. Just as the Sun by its own reflected light enables the planets to shine, the Leo personality desires to be a center of light in which others may bask and shine back.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All the above has a potential for arrogance, and this is the most common Leonine flaw. Yet Leo is a relatively simple personality type with clearly defined needs. If these needs are fulfilled, Leo can be counted on to perform energetically and with honor.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are other important differences between Aries and Leo. First, Leo is a fixed sign, while Aries is cardinal. Thus, unlike Aries, Leo has persistence and can be stubborn.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Second, there is a difference in the social awareness of the two signs. Aries likes to be left alone, free to do what it wishes. When it is aware of interactions with others, it is aware largely in a competitive way. Leo, on the other hand, is beginning to be aware of others as a regular part of its environment. Yet it is only ready to deal with others insofar as they allow it to be the center of the stage. We are still in the first third of the zodiac; the individual is still finding itself with respect to itself. Only when we get to Virgo will the individual find that external necessity must be taken into consideration, and only when we get to Libra will the individual fully realize the need to get along with others. Self-expression is still Leo’s major goal, and the more perfectly this sign can be itself and accepted as such, the better off it is.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Leo’s only real dependency upon others is that it badly needs their acknowledgment. Therefore, unlike Aries, Leo cannot thrive in a vacuum and, despite its drive toward self-expression, Leo can be coerced by others.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All they need do is withhold approval. But being coerced is damaging to Leo, because it knows that only by truly being itself can it be effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark373">However childlike certain aspects of the sign may seem, Leo is fundamentally correct about what it needs, and when it gets what it needs— that is, when it is allowed to be totally, completely, and authentically itself</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">—it is one of the most admirable types of human being.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Leo to the Sun <span class="p">Although this is another fairly good correspondence between a sign and its ruler, there is an important difference between Leo and the Sun. Leo, because of its position in the zodiac, represents an early stage in the development of the individual. The Sun is an energy—one that is neither primitive nor advanced.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Also, much more fundamentally than Leo, the Sun is the drive of an individual to be what it is, a drive for personal self-expression and authenticity. As the Sun moves through the signs it takes on each one’s style of being in turn.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Many astrologers equate Leo, the Sun, and the fifth house. Even though a sign and a house are not the same thing, there are affinities between Leo and the fifth. But a total equation is impossible. Children, and especially childbearing, are among the things symbolized by the fifth house; yet, according to tradition, Leo is a barren sign, that is, unfavorable for childbearing. Leo on the fifth-house cusp was supposed to be a particularly bad sign for a woman who desires children. This old idea may or may not have merit, but it does indicate that equating Leo with the fifth house in all regards is a relatively new idea, one with little basis in tradition.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Leo on Planets <span class="p">Like all fixed signs, Leo has a stabilizing influence. It tends to make the energies of planets located within it operate in a steady, relentless manner: one would not expect a strong Leo type to give up easily. Leo, a fixed fire sign, however, does not have the slowing effect of Taurus, which is fixed earth.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because of the strong ego-orientation of Leo, planets in this sign are more likely to be directed toward the service of self (assuming that they are not, like Neptune, incapable of being bent to that end). Issues surrounding planets in Leo are likely to be areas in which one’s pride or sense of self- esteem is involved. For example, Mercury in Leo would indicate that one speaks one’s own mind forcefully, or that one takes pride in one’s mental capabilities, or (at worst) that one can see only one’s own point of view. Saturn in Leo might give one a strong sense of pride in being disciplined, careful, and righteous. And so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part90.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part92.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
