While it does deal with serious issues, it does not deserve most of the negative things that have been said about it. In fact, it can be very positive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As for polarity with the opposite sign, Scorpio seems to have little to do with Taurus. In a way, Scorpio is more a prefiguration of Pisces. Scorpio is the first encounter with ego death. It completes the process begun in Libra, where the individual entered into a dialogue with another while both individuals remained separate entities. In Scorpio the two merge into one on an emotional level, and this is the first kind of ego death.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">While the above places Scorpio into the scheme of the signs, however, it is not the essence of the sign. The essence is transformation, and it is inherently mystical. This is not the mysticism of Christianity, which is primarily otherworldly, ascetic, and self-denying. It is a mysticism that sees the power of transformation at work in ordinary reality. Rather than deny the physical universe in order to transcend it, Scorpio will immerse itself in physicality and even drown in it in order to go beyond it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Scorpio is the first sign to be aware of the heights and depths of the universe. Feeling the relative nature of all things, it will freely declare there is no difference between good and evil, and be misunderstood as a result. Scorpio sees living as a series of deaths and resurrections, and instead of trying to avoid these experiences it will plunge into them headlong in order</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to experience the revivification that results.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On an ordinary level, this manifests as Scorpio’s fondness for living intensely. Nothing is to be done superficially. It is better completely to experience little than superficially to experience much. Obviously, Scorpio is a dramatic sign, one that loves emotion even while it appears pained by its own experiences. It is better for Scorpio to feel bad than to feel nothing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Concomitantly, Scorpio loves mysteries. It enjoys digging into the depths of any issue or person to find out what is going on inside. As a consequence, Scorpio is associated with investigation, research, and psychotherapy—the last for two reasons, the probing of the psyche and the opportunity to assist in an individual’s self-transformation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whether in criticism or in envy, Scorpio is often called an extremely sexy sign. But if one is referring to the simple enjoyment of sex, Scorpio is not necessarily sexy. In fact, the sign is capable of denying itself sex altogether. Yet there is a relationship between Scorpio and sexuality. It is not the search for pleasure that brings a Scorpio to sex, it is the search for transcendence. The orgasm offers one of the few experiences of ego death and self-transcendence that is accessible to the ordinary human being. And it is characteristic of Scorpio that this is also one of the few such experiences in which ego death and supreme ego gratification are experienced at the same time. Scorpio does not feel the need to separate the two as much as other signs do. To a Scorpio, no matter how attractive and sexy the partner is in other respects, love that does not contain drama and emotional intensity will not endure.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark381">Although the above portrait is fundamentally true to the nature of the sign, it is not an especially accurate portrait of the typical Scorpio. The typical Scorpio often does not appear especially preposessing or dramatic. More than most signs, Scorpios have a tendency to look ordinary, and they can be easily overlooked—that is until a confrontation. Then it is discovered that running close after Taurus, Scorpio is the second most fixed sign in the zodiac, and it is the only water sign that will fight. In fact, it will even enjoy fighting, for fighting is another way for the individual to enjoy a peak experience. War continues partly because it allows people to live at the height of their abilities. The Scorpio, especially, enjoys this. Like the other water signs, Scorpio is sensitive and easily hurt by others, but unlike Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio will fight, often fiercely, when hurt.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Scorpio’s outstanding difficulty with others is the height and depth of its understanding. Much of the emotion Scorpio feels is extremely primitive and does not lend itself to verbal communication and intellectual analysis. Also, much of its knowledge is not easily communicated because it is</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">beyond most people’s understanding. When Scorpios try to communicate what they see, understand, or feel, they are often badly misunderstood. They then tend to keep silent because the misunderstanding that results from silence is better than the misunderstanding that comes from failed communication. Less secure Scorpios may react to the misunderstanding by blaming themselves and concluding that they are rotten inside. Burdened with a sense of inward decay and corruption, they do not realize that the “evil” thoughts they harbor are quite often felt, if a bit less intensely, by others as well. From all this comes Scorpio’s reputation for secrecy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All the above may result in Scorpio seeming self-involved and brooding. Because of the fixed nature of the sign, neither negative nor positive feelings die away rapidly. This is why many writers have described Scorpio as a sign that seeks revenge, one that will harbor long- term grudges. But Scorpio is also slow to anger. If others do not repeat hurts or add insult upon insult, Scorpio is no more vengeful or grudging than any other sign.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Scorpio to Pluto and Mars <span class="p">Scorpio and Pluto fit each other well. Both are symbols of death and resurrection, and of major transformation in general. And both have to do with the kinds of transformation that come about because of processes inherent in whatever is transformed. Both are introverted symbols, being found in persons who are concerned with their inward state and who feel internal experiences intensely.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The main difference between the two symbols is one of degree. Pluto, a planetary symbol, is much more intense, and from its intensity it gains a greater connection with power. The Plutonian is much more likely to desire power than is the Scorpio. But in both cases, whatever power one may gain endangers one unless one only uses it for the benefit of something larger than the self.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mars was the traditional ruler of Scorpio before the discovery of Pluto, but this seems to be one of the worst sign-ruler affinities. Mars is fiery, outgoing, and overt; Scorpio is reserved and subtle. Both symbols can indicate aggression, but Mars is direct and confronting, whereas Scorpio is likely to be devious. Mars releases its energy quickly, Scorpio slowly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark382">But then there seems to have been some change in the meaning of Scorpio since ancient times. In ancient texts, particularly Manilius’s </a><i>Astronomicon</i>, Scorpio is described as more Martian than it is now. One does not have to accept the sidereal zodiac to realize that the tropical signs may change meanings slowly over the ages. One need only recognize that different cultures see symbols differently. Scorpio is now much more</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plutonian than Martian.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Scorpio on Planets <span class="p">Any planet in Scorpio is likely to become an agent for the individual’s transformation. Planets in Scorpio operate with intensity, usually emotional intensity. Airy planets like Mercury do not operate well in Scorpio because the emotionalism of the sign interferes with the detachment necessary for their functioning. Also, Scorpio’s tendency to personalize everything it experiences works badly with social planets. Thus Venus in Scorpio, while not a severe problem, is less able to maintain detachment or objectivity about relationships in which it may become involved.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Moon is often said to be severely debilitated in Scorpio, but I am not inclined to agree. A Scorpio Moon may be difficult for others to understand, but it is at least in touch with its own feelings. It is certainly not a Moon inclined to repress emotion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A large number of planets in Scorpio will increase both the emotionalism and the stubborness of the chart. Issues associated with these planets may not be communicated as clearly as others might wish, but they are not usually misunderstood by those who experience them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part93.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part95.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
