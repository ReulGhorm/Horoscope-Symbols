By extension it is considered the beginning of all planetary cycles. Thus more than any other sign Aries symbolizes beginnings.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Aries is primitive more in the sense of “being first” than “crude.” But it is crude insofar as it is a sign of raw, unharnessed energy with no direction as yet and no clear application. It is an energy of ego drive, saying “I want to become what I am,” but it is not yet what it could be. It is willful, but the will is not stabilized. Its intention can change rapidly: whatever it may want is important now, but tomorrow it may want something else.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Aries is a strong yang energy looking for something to fertilize, something that will manifest its strength on a concrete level. To find this, Aries must learn to adjust to the presence, pressures, and needs of another. This is its fundamental challenge, one it does not often fulfill. It is easier for Aries to preserve its individuality in isolation, backing away from confrontation and mutual accommodation with another. Thus Aries can be</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">asocial or even antisocial.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When Aries does relate to others it likes to lead them. But Aries is not especially interested in power over others: it merely wants power to do what it wants without others making demands.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark362">Its desire to be itself on its own terms also means that Aries needs far less social reinforcement than other signs. This enables Aries to do the unprecedented, to pioneer. As long as others are willing to let it do what it wishes, Aries does not much care if others approve.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In fact, the fiery nature of Aries enables it to act with little concern for whether the action is reasonable, prudent, timely, practical, or even effective, as long as self-expression is achieved. Because it does not have to be practical, Aries can live and work at a high level of abstraction, but the abstraction must reflect personal needs and desires.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As a fire sign, Aries puts out energy more easily than it takes it in: often Aries is a better talker than listener. As a “dry sign” with little water in its makeup, Aries does not handle displays of emotion well, except for enthusiasm, assertiveness, and sometimes anger. Its anger is short lived: once the energy has been expressed, the matter is concluded. Long-term resentment is not in the nature of the sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Aries is often impatient, lacking in persistence and stamina. Its style is to strike frequently and lightly rather than make a strong, sustained attack. Yet its energy level can be high enough to have the same impact as a more sustained approach.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One of the finer side effects of Aries’s need to be itself is that it is unwilling to become compromised by acting falsely or deceitfully. It is not so much that Aries has a moral objection to deceit as that its need to be itself does not square with misrepresentation.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Aries to Mars <span class="p">Mars as the traditional ruler of Aries is one of the closer sign-ruler correspondences. Both symbols relate to the raw assertion of ego energy, the self proclaiming to the universe that it will be what it is and that it will resist others’ attempts to change its nature. Neither is especially cognizant of social contexts, and both work best alone. Both are fiery and willful. The primary difference between them is the difference between a planet and a sign. And there is also a difference of degree. Mars, as a symbol of self-assertion, is much more powerful. But this is true in every case where a planet is similar to a sign.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The assignment of Pluto to Aries by some is not as strange as it might sound. Pluto as the significator of major transformation and as an index of a concern with power is more allied with Scorpio. But Pluto as it is connected with rebirth does logically have an affinity with Aries, the sign</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of spring and the rebirth of nature. Otherwise, however, Pluto and Aries are too different in their symbolism for Pluto to be considered a ruler of this sign.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark363">The Effect of Aries on Planets </a><span class="p">Any planet in Aries operates more decisively, quickly, and in a more ego-oriented way than usual. This can be a problem for planets that are not especially ego-oriented such as Venus, the Moon, or Neptune. Such planets will express themselves somewhat tensely because they cannot easily resolve the conflict between their natural inclinations and those of the sign. In particular, Venus, a planetary energy signifying interpersonal contact, is in conflict between its desire to get along with others and the desire of Aries to do things its own way.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in Aries lose some of the stamina they may otherwise possess. They may act assertively, but if challenged may not be able to sustain a long conflict.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part86.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part88.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
