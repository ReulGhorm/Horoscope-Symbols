This, however, is not at all clear from traditional descriptions of the sign. Just as we stressed some of the more negative aspects of Aquarius to balance the excessively uncritical material that has been written about it, with Pisces we must do the opposite. It is my</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">observation that of all the types in the zodiac except possibly Virgo, Pisceans have the worst image of their sign. This is due to astrological writings, not to the intrinsic flaws of Pisces.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The problem with Pisces is not that it is weak or colorless or without energy. The problem is that the sign symbolizes the most difficult stage in human evolution, the transcendence of the self. In this, Pisces continues the process begun in Aquarius, but with a difference.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In Aquarius the self is submerged in or, more precisely, identified with the social group, often resulting in an inflated ego in a humble disguise. And as we pointed out in the discussion of Aquarius, it is questionable whether the social group to which one belongs is an entity superior to oneself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In Pisces the subordination is not to a social group, but to the universe itself, and that which propels it. Whatever one may feel about a God, there is something that makes the universe (the “one-turning” in Latin) One. The ego—born, developed, completed, and socialized through the other signs—is now surrendered in Pisces to something higher. Personal systems of reality, personal ideas of right and wrong, are now to be subordinated to What Is. In the language of mysticism, Pisces symbolizes the surrender of the soul to God. Yet few individuals ever do this. It is something difficult to do half-way, and incomplete self-surrender can bring disaster.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another aspect of Pisces must be understood: it is both an end and a beginning. The zodiac is not a circle, but a helix, so that each time one goes around one has also moved up. Pisces is the last phase of each turn of the helix, but it is also the phase just prior to Aries. As such, it stands for the stage just prior to the birth of a new self. Indeed, Pisces at the end of a cycle indicating surrender of the mature self is a prelude to rebirth at a higher level in the next encounter with Aries. Thus Pisces can be looked at as either the pre-egoic or the post-egoic state of consciousness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The structure of one’s ego gives rise to the nature of one’s reality system. Thus we can see that Pisces is a sign that has either not yet developed a reality system or has just transcended one (it is this that leads to Pisces’ highly imaginative quality).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Pisces symbol is two fishes swimming in opposite directions, and like Sagittarius and Gemini, Pisces is traditionally referred to as a dual sign. There are two types of Piscean: the advanced (Pisces as the last stage in the evolution of the archetypal ego or self) and the primitive (Pisces as the stage just prior to a new beginning in Aries).</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In both types the ego is less strongly defined than in other signs.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Consequently the desire to assert oneself, to be something in particular, is less. Both Piscean types are extremely receptive. In the primitive type this leads to passivity and inaction and to being a victim because one is unwilling to take responsibility. In the advanced type it leads to a desire to know the truth at a deep spiritual level, and even to sacrifice oneself for the truth. This is a manifestation of the martyr, in the true sense of the word, as opposed to the victim.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As we have said, the reality system is either not strongly developed in the primitive type, or one is detached from it in the advanced type. This gives the advanced type the ability to deal with alternate realities, to see aspects of being that others would consider impossible. The primitive type may merely be confused.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Both types may glimpse things that are invisible to most people. Pisces is connected to psychic ability (though much more than a strong Pisces indication is necessary for one to be psychic, and one need not be strongly Piscean if other indications are strong). In most Pisceans the psychic tendency comes over as sensitivity to people around them such that energies and impressions are easily picked up. Because Pisces tends to experience these energies as its own, when the energies are sufficiently negative, both types can become weakened.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To both types things are not as clearly distinct from one another as they might be to another sign. Categories are weakened. The advanced type sees much more unity in the universe than is immediately apparent to others, while the primitive type is again merely confused.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Caught in a world it is not yet quite ready to enter, the primitive type is likely to take refuge in fantasy. Even the advanced type often takes refuge in a private world to which few others are admitted. The remote quality of many Pisceans is actually the consequence of their hypersensitivity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its lack of ego emphasis, the Pisces type is often attracted to social service: taking care of the physically or mentally ill or of others who need to be looked after. This may seem similar to Aquarius’s social idealism, but Pisces is without the identification of self with the group that can result in covert ego-inflation. In Pisces the self is more truly subordinated.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But there is one danger in the Piscean kind of service. Primitive Pisceans may try to shore up their shaky egos by taking care of those they deem less fortunate. The problem is that in order to maintain their one-up position, these Pisceans must make sure that those they are “helping” never get better. This pernicious type of covert egotism is also a danger with Neptune.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark393">Most Pisceans are neither primitive nor advanced types, but mixtures in varying degrees. An individual may be sensitive and compassionate yet at the same time the victim of surrounding negative energies, or be aware of the infinite possibilities in the universe yet at the same time be confused by them. Whether Pisces is viewed as coming into or going out of the world, in neither case is it completely here. Coming to grips with conventional reality systems when it may in fact have something superior—this is the central dilemma of the sign.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Pisces to Neptune and Jupiter <span class="p">The connection between Pisces and Neptune is strong. Both are symbols of ego- transcendence and union with the infinite. Both also confer a great deal of sensitivity and imagination. And in both, imagination may go to excess and become illusion and deception. Even the conflicts associated with Neptune are found with Pisces. Both are connected to sacrifice and victimhood; both often signify a lack of strong ego; both are very watery with all that that implies.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter as the traditional ruler of Pisces is not as easy to see. Where both Neptune and Pisces place strong emphasis on faith, Jupiter wants knowledge. Where Neptune and Pisces tend to be retiring and passive, Jupiter can be arrogant and assertive. Perhaps the main connection is that Jupiter, like both Pisces and Neptune, has a religious dimension. This arises directly out of Jupiter’s association with integration, the relationship between parts and wholes. But Jupiter is much more associated with theology than with direct mystical experience: it is the priest rather than the mystic. Therefore, although Jupiter is rather well-placed in Pisces, we have to give Pisces to Neptune.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Pisces on Planets <span class="p">A large number of planets in Pisces tends to reduce the forcefulness of the personality while increasing its level of empathy and its receptivity to others. Planets that are strongly yin tend in Pisces to take on a dreamy, fantasy-prone quality. This can be very creative and imaginative, but may also weaken the individual’s hold on reality. The Moon is especially vulnerable to this. Venus may become excessively romantic under Pisces’s influence, but it is also capable of the most selfless kind of loving.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is planets associated with the will and with energy that suffer most in Pisces. Mars in Pisces lacks energy, and Pisces does not give it much scope for its willfulness. People with either the Sun or Mars in Pisces can successfully dedicate themselves to a purpose that transcends their own narrow individuality. This will release the energy that might otherwise be</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">caught up in Piscean conflicts such as those described above.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Saturn, because of its strong and rather narrow reality orientation, is also not at its best in Pisces. Jupiter, on the other hand, whether or not it rules Pisces, is at its best in this sign, which gives infinite scope to the Jupiterian need for consciousness expansion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part97.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part99.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
