Work, employees. Sickness. Hygiene, nutrition. Small animals<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Servitude and work are matters that deny the individual immediate gratification in favor of an immediate necessity. Even as the fifth was a house of self-expression, the sixth can be thought of as a house of self- denial, insofar as the ego wishes something for itself right now. The sixth</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">pertains to all activities pursued not for their own sake (as in the fifth), but for the sake of something else. This something else may be another purpose one chooses, external necessity one does not consciously choose, or circumstances that limit one’s freedom of choice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The signification of the sixth house is not always pleasant, but like Saturn energy it is necessary for human happiness. Any activity done for its own sake must be supported by other activities that assist it in its functioning. In the section on the fifth house we mentioned the athlete who undergoes rigorous training in order to enjoy playing a sport. Keeping in mind the pleasurable activity that the work supports, most individuals can put up with short-term denial of gratification in favor of a greater return later on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">People have problems with the sixth house when the supportive activity, the work, becomes too far removed from the pleasurable activity it is supporting. Then the work becomes oppressive, a denial of play rather than a supporter of it. This is a common problem in a culture that respects work more than self-expressive activity. We tend to think of work as an end in itself, losing track of the fact that all work eventually, directly or indirectly, serves the free self-expression of the individual. Self-expression is the ultimate end of work. When the relationship of an activity to its point or purpose becomes unclear, there is pointless activity. Play or self- expressive activity is never pointless; the only pointless activity is work that ultimately serves no self-expressive purpose.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">An objection could be raised here. What about self-sacrifice, altruism, people who work for the benefit of others? Willing self-sacrifice is a free choice an individual makes as an act of self-expression. If I give of myself to you for your benefit, even when for me there is no clear benefit and perhaps even harm, that is my statement of who I am and what my life is about. The purpose served by the action is that I am making a statement purely for its own sake, perhaps for something in which I believe. And that in which I believe is, after all, an aspect of what I am.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The same can be said for some people who seem to work constantly. For them it is not truly work. Some of the hardest-working people I know are strongly fifth-house, not sixth-house people, because what others may consider work is their form of play. But people with a strong Saturn or sixth-house emphasis as well may often feel compelled to give others the impression they are working, because working seems nobler; we all have our little ego games.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ancients called the sixth the house of slavery. In doing so, they pointed up the chief pathology of this house: that its activities can become</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">divorced from supporting the self and self-expression. Slavery by definition is forcing people to work ceaselessly for ends that do not serve them at all but always something or someone else.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">That the sixth is supposed to relate to employees and servants reveals something else about this house. It is the house not only of one’s own work activities, but also of receiving the benefits of other people’s labor. Put another way, this is the house of one’s relationship to work and service in general.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Sickness is another major sixth-house concern. Whereas the first house was more involved with the strength and physical characteristics of the body, the sixth is more taken up with factors that interfere with the body’s functioning. Some commentators relate illness to the other functions of the sixth by calling this the house of efficiency—health, they reason, being simply the efficiency of the body. I think this misses the essence of the sixth house, which is factors in the inner or outer life of the individual that deny self-expression. Sickness not only inhibits physical self-expression, it can arise when self-expression on any level is thwarted.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To understand this idea further, remember that sixth-house activities do not always have a clear purpose or point. What is not generally recognized in modern literature is that the sixth house may describe factors that seem to interfere gratuitiously with self-expression. Of course, even illness may have a purpose in the context of one’s entire life (or even past lives, if you will). But to normal ego consciousness, illness usually seems unnecessary. Taking this admittedly narrow view, sixth-house affairs may seem to interfere pointlessly with one’s life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The relationship of a sixth-house activity to its purpose is important here. If there is a purpose, you must always try to understand its relationship to the sixth-house activity. If there is no purpose, you need to create one. If this is not done, illness can result. Illness usually develops in a body weakened by an inappropriate style of activity or a debilitating psychological state. For example, illness can result from work (also a sixth- house matter) that does not serve the individual’s interests or that demands too much of the individual’s energies for the benefit obtained. When one understands the reasons for illness, it is often possible to improve one’s life tremendously.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some who do medical astrology have concluded that the sixth house’s connection with illness is at best limited when compared with the eighth. Certainly the eighth, traditionally the house of death, is more concerned with life-threatening illnesses. Though I find that the sixth does indeed have something to do with illnesses, I believe that the eighth and first</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are implicated as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nutrition and hygiene seem related to the health and sickness issue, and in a way of course they are, in that they maintain health. But fundamentally these are subsidiary activities needed to maintain the body and mind so that the individual can function and the self can be expressed. As such, these are related to the work rather than the health aspect of the sixth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">“Small animals,” the last remaining signification of this house, probably comes from the days when small animals like cats and dogs were kept mainly for catching vermin or guarding property. Insofar as such animals are like servants they belong to the sixth, but insofar as they are pets (that is, kept just for fun), they are better symbolized by the fifth.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">The sixth house symbolizes the psychological factors enabling one to defer self-gratification. This is probably the nearest equivalent on the house level to Saturn.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like the first house, the sixth is just below the horizon. It is in the lower hemisphere, which corresponds on the internal level to the inner part of the psyche, but it is right next to the upper hemisphere. As such, it is influenced by awareness of external situations. It represents the part of the unconscious mind that absorbs energies and influences coming down into the inner self from conscious experience. It is the house where experience is incorporated into the psyche.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This is undoubtedly one of the bases for this being a house of illness. Illness can be a symptom of energies coming into the inner self that are difficult for the mind or body to handle.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark470">Relational Level </a><span class="p">The sixth house’s being just below the horizon is also significant at the relational level. If we think of energies coming down into the personal sphere through the western horizon, we can see that this is the house that also has to absorb experience on a conscious level. This is undoubtedly why this house is concerned with necessities that originate in external circumstances. It is at this level that the sixth is the house of work and other activities not pursued for the sake of individual self-expression.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In regard to relationships, the sixth symbolizes all those in which one is subservient to others or others are subservient to oneself. It also indicates relationships formed out of necessity, duty, or responsibility rather than out of self-expression or pleasure.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At the objective level the sixth house represents one’s experience of employers and employees. Ones attitudes toward necessity and service affect how one reacts to such people. If one has</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">difficulty relating to one’s own work in the broad sense of the word, one will have difficulty in relating to those who serve one and to those whom one must serve.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The sixth house also signifies the day-to-day activities of one’s profession: the actual tasks one has to perform. One’s work as an expression of who one is in society, however, belongs to the tenth house. The sixth house is the chief area determining one’s profession only if one’s profession is primarily a means of supporting oneself and does not fulfill one’s life purpose. For example, the job of grocery clerk, unless a person is unusually dedicated to and identified with such work, is more likely to be signified by the sixth house than the tenth. In such cases the tenth house will signify whatever activity one uses to make one’s life meaningful regardless of whether it brings an income.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Sixth House <span class="p">An abundance of planets in the sixth indicates that the issue of work may take up a large part of one’s consciousness. But it does not necessarily mean one loves work or is hard- working. To the contrary, one may often feel that the world demands too much, that too little room is left for whatever one really wants to do. But if there are indications that the individual finds self-expression in work, a strong sixth-house type will enjoy working.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A sixth-house emphasis may also mean a great concern about health. This is certainly consistent with the symbolism and in accord with my experience. One often observes sixth-house types who work so hard to remain healthy that they never get in touch with what health is for—the enjoyment of life. The dictum “Eat to live, not live to eat” can be carried too far. This is a classic instance of sixth-house functions that are out of touch with the purpose they serve.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Contrary to the older literature, I do not find that sixth-house types tend to be more sickly. Because of their concern with taking care of themselves, they may in fact be very healthy indeed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Of all planets, Saturn is the most at home in the sixth, except that it may signify one who forgets what the work is for. The other planets in the sixth usually signify what areas work may come from or with what areas in life it is associated.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark471">While the Sun may not be as exuberant and self-expressive in the sixth as in other houses, it does get one strongly involved in whatever one may have to work at. None of the planets really interferes with the basic symbolism of the sixth house. Even Uranus usually only signifies that the work is performed under Uranian conditions or with Uranian entities.</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part116.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part118.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
