The aspect itself introduces almost no coloring of its own, with one notable exception discussed below.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part41.htm#bookmark205" class="s31">The main consideration when delineating a conjunction is whether or not the two planets so combined are compatible. </a><a href="part41.htm#bookmark205" class="a">Table </a>4<span style=" color: #000;">, “Planetary Compatibilities,” shows how likely a given conjunction is to work out constructively. (It is also of some use with other aspects, even though they complicate the picture by introducing qualities of their own.) Although any combination of planets can be made into a source of strength, obviously some planetary energies are more compatible than others; those that are less so are more likely to be sources of difficulty in a person’s life. It is possible, however, to make positive qualities out of difficult combinations, or make the worst out of usually good ones.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The one distinctive quality of the conjunction is that it is often difficult for the person whose chart has this aspect to be clear about its effects. Usually the conjunction colors the personality so completely that it is hard for the native to get perspective on this aspect. Though the effects of a conjunction may not be apparent to the native, they are obvious to others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The conjunction has a dynamic quality. It tends to signify patterns of action rather than passive states of being: that is, its effects usually consist of events or changes in a person’s life. These are not necessarily events in the physical world; they may be psychological. The conjunction shares this eventful quality with the hard aspects of the two-series.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part41.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part43.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
