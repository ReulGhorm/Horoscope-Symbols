Thus the midpoints I look for first are those attached to individual factors in the chart. Only when I am interested in finding out more about a specific issue will I look at midpoint axes that are not occupied by a single factor. In a few cases, such axes will be the focus of a number of midpoints and will therefore have importance. The effects of individual midpoints will be seen most clearly when they are set off by dynamic factors such as transits, solar arc directions, or progressions.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 654pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="872" alt="image" src="Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 135pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark267">Figure 25.

Here are the criteria I use for picking out the important ones.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">1. Midpoints involving the Sun, Moon, Midheaven, or Ascendant are to be taken more seriously than others. One or both factors making up the midpoint may come from this group, or the midpoint may be in a hard aspect to one of these single factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">2. Direct midpoints—ones that are conjunct or opposite (really the same, as shown above) a single factor are more important than midpoints that aspect a single factor by square, semisquare, or sesquiquadrate. I find that direct midpoints are as important as major aspects in influencing a chart. One neglects them at one’s peril; if you use no other type of midpoint, use these.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">3. Midpoints of single points that also happen to be in aspect to each other are more intense and sensitive than those where the two single points are not in aspect. Even relatively minor aspects should be considered, and also those that would ordinarily seem out of orb. I think this phenomenon is responsible for the large orbs other astrologers often get away with on major aspects. In a T-square, grand cross, grand trine, or other aspect pattern that is also a midpoint configuration, one often sees orbs that are larger than 5°, and yet the aspect still seems to operate strongly. I find invariably that the midpoint of one or more of the pairs of planets involved closely aspects one or more of the other factors by a hard angle. This ties the factors together in a way that no large-orbed major aspect could. One should always check these major aspect patterns to determine whether or not the midpoints they form are in close aspect to one or more of the factors in the aspect pattern.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">4. With midpoints, as with any other worthwhile technique, a theme should be repeated several times in a chart if it is to be taken seriously. Possibly the one exception to this is direct midpoint combinations, but data from these should, like any other indication, still be checked against the rest of the chart.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part60.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part62.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
