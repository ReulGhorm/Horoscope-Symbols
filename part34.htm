These, the asteroids, were unknown until the nineteenth century, and were not used by astrologers until Eleanor Bach published an asteroid ephemeris in 1973. Following the practice of the <i>American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac</i>, she picked the first four asteroids to be discovered: Ceres (discovered in 1801), Pallas (1802), Juno (1804), and Vesta (1807). Ceres is the largest asteroid known, but there are others that are larger than any of the other three.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">With the asteroids we are in the midst of a potential revolution and a potential disaster. The revolution is the possibility of extending astrological symbolism using real rather than hypothetical bodies. The disaster is that there are thousands of asteroids and other minor bodies orbiting the Sun, and using present-day astrological techniques there is no way of accounting for all of them in a chart. Thus far in astrology it has been held (implicitly, at least) that the size of a body has no relation to its effectiveness. This is most dramatically illustrated in the case of Pluto, which is both small (about the size of Mercury) and extremely distant. All other bodies in the solar system that are used by astrologers are either large or much closer or both. The question with asteroids is: can we afford, practically speaking, to extend downward the size limit of bodies that we use in the chart? The asteroids are very small: all the known ones put together would be smaller than any known major planet. They would not even add up to the total mass</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the Moon. If we do consider the asteroids, then logically we have to consider all orbiting bodies of any size whatsoever. Can you imagine the astrologer of the future saying to a client, “You have the Perseid meteors retrograde on your Midheaven”?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are several ways out of this controversy. The first and easiest would be to ignore the asteroids altogether. But clinical experience with Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta already suggests that they do have observable qualities, ones that do not repeat the symbolism of the other planets, and which hence add new information to the chart. For this reason I find this the least acceptable solution.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A second route would be to figure out some way of dealing with the asteroids and other small bodies as a group or set of groups. The asteroids, the smaller ones at least, travel in families. Perhaps the resultant of the mass vectors (the average position, in a manner of speaking) could be used to represent a group of asteroids. This would require a change in the present procedure of giving asteroids the same kind of individuality as the major planets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A third alternative is simply to continue giving the asteroids the individual kind of symbolic treatment already given the first four. In practice, what I see coming is assigning individuality to the larger ones and ignoring the smaller ones. I suspect there will be a de facto limit beyond which we will not go in using smaller bodies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One way of defending the use of the first four to be discovered (rather than the four largest) is to say that the effect of celestial bodies is in some way related to human consciousness of them rather than to their physical properties. As the first to be discovered they no doubt made a greater impact than the thousands later to be observed.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part86.htm#bookmark359" class="s31" name="bookmark124">Here are brief delineations of the four commonly used asteroids. These descriptions are not intended to be complete; much fuller treatment is given by writers like Eleanor Bach, Zipporah Dobyns, and Emma Belle Donath. The following are a composite of my own findings and those of others. (For the relationship of these asteroids to the signs, see the discussions of Virgo and Libra in </a><a href="part86.htm#bookmark359" class="a">Chapter </a>11<span style=" color: #000;">.)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ceres <span class="p">is related to the symbol of the earth mother, as is the Moon. But it seems to relate to nurture on a material, practical level more than a psychological one. It is connected with duty, responsibility, and domestic crafts. I would also associate it with gardening and agriculture.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Pallas<span class="p">, like Ceres, Juno, and Vesta, is a feminine symbol, but a very independent one. It seems to relate to the critical faculty, and to a kind of sharp, incisive mentality that enjoys a good debate. It is fond of making</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">distinctions. Of the four asteroids, its effects are the hardest to discern, possibly because its orbit is by a wide margin the farthest inclined from the ecliptic (34.8°).</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Juno <span class="p">is associated with marriage and partnership between the sexes. I find that, especially in women’s charts, it often indicates an ambivalence about whether to be associated with someone or to be free. In a man’s chart, it often describes the kind of marital partner he will choose.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Vesta<span class="p">’s orbit is the least inclined to the ecliptic of the four asteroids (by only 7.13°), and possibly for this reason its qualities show the most clearly of the four. Vesta can be thought of as the planetary equivalent of the sixth house, representing the principle of the denial of short-term gratification in favor of long-range goals. Its nature is ascetic, able to make sacrifices in the name of duty. It seems to be difficult in any matter having to do with sexual expression or other pleasurable activities. It is often connected with celibacy. Some authors feel it has to do with cultural ritual and tradition as well.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Chiron <span class="p">In 1977 the astronomer Charles Kowal discovered a minor planet between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus and subsequently named it Chiron after the first of the mythical centaurs. It is believed by many to have a connection with consciousness-expanding teachings and with initiation into higher consciousness.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Fixed Stars <span class="p">Fixed stars were once used routinely by astrologers. But they have not continued in extensive use, for several reasons. First, their traditional delineations tend to be of the dramatic fortunetelling sort. They usually are malefic and designate various kinds of disasters. For example, Algol on the Midheaven is supposed, among other meanings, to denote death by decapitation. Such fatalistic delineations are not considered respectable in modern astrology, and astrologers have not yet developed alternative ideas on the symbolism of most fixed stars.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Second, most of the fixed stars are way off the ecliptic. It is therefore not clear how one should handle them with regard to aspects along the ecliptic and placement in houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark125">Third, there is the same problem as with the asteroids, only more so. There are five or six thousand fixed stars visible to the naked eye, and millions more that are not visible. If we limit ourselves to visible stars, then what do we do with planets that are not visible to the naked eye?</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, many astrologers agree that some fixed stars, mostly those near the ecliptic, have observable effects, and take note of them whenever these stars are near an important point in the chart. Usually only</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">conjunctions with fixed stars are used, although sometimes oppositions are used too. Vivian Robson’s <i>Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology </i>is a good summary of the existing lore on the subject, and also makes clear some of the difficulties.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Hypothetical Planets <span class="p">Many astrologers use points that behave like planets, but which have not yet been observed astronomically. These hypothetical planets include the extra planets of the Uranian school, (Cupido, Hades, Zeus, and Kronos, proposed by Alfred Witte, and Apollon, Admetos, Vulkanus, and Poseidon, proposed by his follower Friedrich Sieggruen); planets advocated by Charles A. Jayne, Jr. (Rex, Sigma, Jason, Isis, Pan, Morya, Hermes, Osiris, Midas, Athena, and Lion); planets advocated by Ivy Goldstein Jacobsen (Lilith and Lulu); and others such as Transpluto, advocated by Theodor Landscheidt and the Ebertin family in Germany, and Vulcan (not to be confused with the Uranian Vulkanus). Some of these points have been derived by psychics, some by mathematical means from perturbations of existing orbits, and some by astrologers noting points of energy that seem to move along the zodiac like planets. There are dozens of these “bodies,” and some, I find, especially the eight Uranian planets, seem to work.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like the asteroids, hypothetical planets threaten to bury the horoscope in an unmanageable complexity of details. And, unlike the asteroids, these planets are only hypothetical. The positions of most of them have been found using unsafe assumptions about the accuracy of astrological techniques, and almost all appear to move in circular rather than elliptical orbits, something done by no known astronomical body. (The exceptions are the four Uranian bodies put forth by Witte.) This means that either these bodies are totally imaginary, or the early “observations” of their orbits only approximated a circle. If the early “observations” are only approximate, ephemerides based on them grow more and more inaccurate as they extend beyond the time the observations were made.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In either case, I do not recommend using hypothetical planets as a basic technical device. I would never suggest that anything in astrology not be investigated, but without further research I would not recommend basing anything seriously upon hypothetical planets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part33.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part35.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
