The horoscope thus becomes a mandala, an ancient symbol for wholeness that yet is able to deal with the illusion of division.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Eastern Hemisphere <span class="p">On the eastern side, planets are rising. This means that the planetary energies are moving away from the lower, more personal pole of the chart toward the upper, more social pole. This half thus symbolizes that which is acted on by the inner self (though not always successfully, as we shall see with the twelfth house). Energies situated in this half have to do with the world’s perception of the self, and they are considered to be more active and under personal control.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">264</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">According to many authors, the chart’s eastern hemisphere is associated with being self-determining, that is, with being the source of most of the initiatives in one’s life. Someone who has many planets in this half would be one who takes action, and therefore I call such a person an actor as opposed to an experiencer.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Actors are often said to be in control of their destinies, people who are seldom afflicted with self-doubt. They are supposed to take the initiative and never wait for others, always to act and never to react. But I find that the only thing that can be said about actor types is that they tend to act first and observe later. This does not necessarily make them more effective or more in control of their lives, as is often alleged. In order to be effective, one must not only take action; one must also act consciously, with a clear idea of the consequences and of how others might react. In other words, to be in control one must not only take action but also observe others. Actors who do not do this are as out of control of their destinies as anyone else.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark435">Though a large gathering of planets in this hemisphere, especially in the first house, seems to denote this type of personality, some caution is needed in identifying an actor. The planets in the east should not be ones that, like Saturn, tend to frustrate action, or, like Neptune, weaken the basis on which one would act. Saturn tends to make one very cautious and too concerned with the feelings, needs, and opinions of others to act precipitously. Neptune is a weakening planet in all matters that require self- assertion and self-confidence. The closer these planets are to the Ascendant, the greater will be their tendency to cancel out the effects of an eastern- hemisphere emphasis.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets that tend to strengthen the actor temperament are the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Pluto. Yin planets such as the Moon and Venus tend to weaken the actor temperament, though they are not as debilitating as Saturn or Neptune.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="s31">Planets in the twelfth house may also weaken the actor temperament. For the reasons, see the section on the twelfth house in </a><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="a">Chapter </a>14<span style=" color: #000;">. Though people can overcome planets in the twelfth, most do not do so completely, at least as regards using planetary energies for taking the initiative. For most people, twelfth-house energies require caution and consideration before being allowed to manifest.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Western Hemisphere <span class="p">Planets in the western half of the chart are moving away from the upper, social pole of the chart toward the lower, personal pole. This half thus symbolizes one’s experience of and perception of the world. It represents the part of the self that is acted upon, that is passive and not under one’s personal control.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">265</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Corresponding to the eastern-hemisphere actor type is the western- hemisphere experiencer. According to widespread tradition, those with an emphasis in the western hemisphere are supposed to be passive and out of control: that is, victims. But it does not take much observation of actual horoscopes to show that this is not the case.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What actually happens with experiencer types is that they observe before acting. They are more a considering type than actors are. All they need do to gain control over their lives is to take control of their reactions to any given situation. By controlling their response and making it appropriate to the situation, experiencers can become as powerful an influence over the course of events as actors are. They will certainly be more in control than actors who do not observe others’ responses to their actions, or actors who never bother to look before acting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The real difference between eastern- and western-hemisphere types is that one type tends to think in terms of direct action first, while the other thinks in terms of getting maximum understanding first. Of course, just as one can have the negative actor type who invariably goes off half-cocked, one can also have the truly passive, overcautious experiencer who is so concerned about observing that he or she never acts. Both these types are out of control.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark436">As with determining the actor type, there is more to evaluating the experiencer than counting planets in the western hemisphere. When in the west and especially when near the Descendant, the very yang planets such as Mars and the Sun and sometimes Pluto and Uranus may indicate the way people act with respect to others rather than the energies that they experience from others. This may cause such people to behave more like actors. The Moon, Neptune, and Venus here heighten the tendency to be an experiencer. Saturn does not seem to have much effect one way or the other. A prominent Saturn will always heighten caution and slow down one’s taking action, but Saturn in the west is not more extreme in this respect than Saturn in the east.</a></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31">Just as the twelfth house seems anomalous with respect to the eastern hemisphere, the fifth house is anomalous in the west. As we shall see in </a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="a">Chapters </a>13 <a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="s31">and </a>14<span style=" color: #000;">, the fifth is primarily a house of energy release and self-expression. There is little about the fifth to suggest that it is predominantly oriented toward experience rather than action. Yet something about the fifth does show its western orientation: fifth-house activities usually involve being with other people, and, while the primary emphasis is on the self, there must be an awareness of others that is not usually to be found with a first-house emphasis. Nevertheless, a strong planetary</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">266</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">emphasis in the fifth house does not usually indicate a classic experiencer type.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Midheaven <span class="p">Within the upper and lower hemispheres, described above, there are obviously points that represent the highest and lowest a planet can go before changing direction. These are the upper and lower poles already referred to. Symbolically, let us call these the poles of the outer and inner. In the circle they are up and down, but in the psyche they are out and in. In the horoscope these poles are represented by the Midheaven above the horizon and the I.C. below it. Just as the Ascendant and Descendant most perfectly embodied all the attributes that were assigned to the eastern and western hemispheres, the Midheaven and I.C. are the quintessence of all that the upper and lower hemispheres represent.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Midheaven is a point of the maximum externalization of the self. It represents the social world, farthest removed from personal and intimate life. Thus it is considered to refer to one’s social position, role, status, and life direction as expressed in external terms. Traditionally it has been associated with one’s career, and this is true to the extent that one defines oneself by what one does. But there are other points that relate to career as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Midheaven is not especially informative about personality characteristics, but it is nevertheless extremely important in one’s life, as it helps to define what one does rather than merely how one does it. Perhaps the most important attribute of the Midheaven is that it helps to identify what people need to do with their lives in order to grow.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark437">The I.C. As the center of energy in the lower or nothern hemisphere, the I.C. is the most intimate, personal point in the mundane circle. It represents one’s innermost feelings, roots, and sense of being, and it relates to the internal definition of the self. Also, being opposite the Midheaven, it represents the base laid down in one’s past and private life for the roles that one will play according to the symbolism of the M.C.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Meridian Axis The meridian axis, consisting of the Midheaven on one end and the I.C. on the other, describes one’s orientation in the world, both social and personal. The axis has to do with one’s sense of identity, but rather than telling much about the way one expresses oneself, the Midheaven-I.C. axis indicates the objective toward which one is working and the experiences from which one is coming. Whereas the horizon had more to do with how one reaches out to one’s surroundings in space, the meridian has more to do with how one travels forward and back in time. Whereas the horizon axis describes how one interacts with others, the meridian axis relates to the individual more purely as an individual.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Various German schools of astrology have gone so far as to consider the meridian axis as being the “I” or ego. There is merit to this, but it is an oversimplification.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">How the four quadrants formed by the horoscope angles are subdivided into houses will be the topic of the remaining chapters in this book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="161" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_050.png"/></span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark438"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12pt;">*</span></a>In the Southern Hemisphere the situation would be reversed. The Sun would be to the north of an observer. If you were facing north, the Sun would stil rise in the east, but this would be to your right. It would appear to move counterclockwise to culimination, and would set in the west to your left. The horoscope as usualy drawn for the Southern Hemisphere is a mirror image of the correct representation. This is so that astrologers, educated in the Northern Hemispheric viewpoint, do not have to think in terms of planets rising and setting counterclockwise and transiting the zodiac clockwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part103.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part105.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
