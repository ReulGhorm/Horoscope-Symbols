Though aspects generated by dividing by nine would clearly fall into this family, astrologers are less certain about</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">their nature. Therefore, these will be discussed under their own heading further on, and I will treat only the trine, sextile, semisextile, and quincunx here.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The three-series aspects are called “soft” because their action is less dynamic and usually less harsh than the “hard” aspects just discussed. Whereas two-series aspects are unstable and tend to force changes, three- series aspects produce energy patterns that are not only stable, but in fact resist change. The attributes of one’s life that come about from three-series aspects are those that one can count on to persist throughout all life’s changes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But three-series aspects are not really static. They do result in progress and change, but they have the overall effect of producing no <i>net </i>change. They symbolize a dynamic equilibrium—a situation in which two or more processes occur simultaneously and cancel each other’s effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The best example of dynamic equilibrium is the human body. You eat food and give off wastes in perfect balance, resulting in little net change. If you eat too much, you gain weight; if too little, you lose. Both gaining and losing weight are signs that the body’s dynamic equilibrium is disturbed. The body has built-in mechanisms that resist upsets to its dynamic equilibrium.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark213">Trines, sextiles, and the other three-series aspects have the same function in life. A chart having too few of these often signifies an individual who has difficulty in finding balance, and whose life seems in a continual state of change. But change also creates the potential for growth, so that too many of these aspects can actually interfere with the process of evolution, both spiritual and psychological. I call this “the curse of the trine.” It simply serves to point out that the so-called “good” aspects, as the three-series were once called, can have negative consequences. A dominance of three- series aspects indicates one who has chosen to take a relatively safe course in evolution with few risks, but also less possibility of growth. It is neither better nor worse to choose either the hard-aspect or the soft-aspect course: it is simply a matter of style. Morality, personal integrity, and courage have nothing to do with one route of evolution as opposed to the other.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">An excess of trines, sextiles, semisextiles, and quincunxes can create problems as has been indicated. When one is caught in a situation where change seems necessary, there may not be enough energy to get oneself moving. People having too many soft aspects may seem lethargic, waiting for the universe to make up their minds for them or for circumstances to force them down a path of action. Or they may simply respond over and over to the same problem in the same way.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the plus side, a little energy goes a long way with three-series aspects. Particularly with trines, the universe and the inner self offer little resistance to activity that is appropriate to the planets involved. The activity almost seems destined to happen. And yet it usually serves to maintain a status quo, not to bring about a new order as the two-series aspects would tend to do.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Trine (120°) <span class="p">The trine is the most potent aspect of the three-series, although it is subtle in its effects, especially if one is looking for events. Like the other three-series aspects, the trine indicates that the energies linked do not resist or conflict with each other in any way. They are in a state of equilibrium with respect to one another. Whenever one chooses to act according to the nature of the energies combined by a trine, there is ease of action and lack of difficulty—so long as one chooses to act within the framework of a status quo into one’s life. Trinal action does not readily alter whatever circumstances may be in force at a particular time, except to restore balance after a previous state of imbalance. In mutual aspects (aspects that occur between two planets in the sky on a given day, not in the birth chart), trines often signify the end of a period of activity and the restoration of peace and quiet after a previous period of turmoil. People having many trines are often more resistant to turmoil and stress than others, seeming not to notice that anything especially untoward is happening. This is not insensitivity, however; it is the result of an inner balance that is not easily upset.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark214">When trines do signify events, they are events in which one is passive. Things seem to fall into one’s lap and work out of their own accord. For example, someone with natal Mars </a><i>square </i>Jupiter may have a great sense of timing and know when to make a move (assuming that the person is disciplined enough not to make rash moves, which is a negative tendency of this aspect). When someone is successful with this square, others are likely to attribute the success to good timing and skillful application of energies. With the <i>trine </i>of Mars and Jupiter, however, affairs seem to work out because of “dumb luck,” or so others might see it. Actually, what is happening is that in those affairs of life that are signified by the trine, the individual has a positive intention and an optimistic expectation that does not even consider the possibility of failure. Also, the energy of this aspect is not sufficiently stormy to cause one to take risks that are unlikely to succeed. Being able to proceed in any matter without a sense of stress or resistance and without trying to push circumstances too far is an almost certain guarantee of success. An analogy might be drawn with martial arts, in which the primary tactic is to allow the energies of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">135</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">aggressor to destroy themselves by not resisting them and in fact even assisting them. Thus one is able to rechannel those energies to one’s own ends with a minimum of effort. Trines often work like this.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The principal flaw of trines is their passivity. Whenever the individual is challenged by the environment to make a change or adjustment, the energy is lacking. The old patterns indicated by the trine persist, and even if they are temporarily deflected, they soon return. Other astrological writers have characterized excessively trinal charts as too easy, but in fact they can be difficult. Sometimes they can assist the negative effects of a hard aspect in ways that make it almost impossible to change.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A man of my acquaintance possessed a grand trine (in which three planets form an equilateral triangle in the zodiac) of the Moon, Uranus, and Neptune. The Moon, in addition, was closely opposed by Pluto. Uranus and Neptune together relate to alternative states of consciousness (any state of consciousness—like trance, sleep, hypnotic states, meditative states, and above all, complete unconsciousness—that is other than the normal state in which we handle everyday life). The Moon signifies one’s inward emotional state and, in a male chart, those energies most likely to be projected onto women. The Moon-Pluto opposition signifies intense emotional encounters and the likelihood of power struggles with women. With the Moon trine Neptune and Uranus, he was spontaneously attracted to women who were ideally beautiful (Neptune = ideal), and quite unusual (Uranus). He would then become involved in power struggles with these women as he tried to dominate them by pointing out every flaw in their beauty or personality. Eventually this would become intolerable for the woman and she would leave him. The effect of the trine here is that it created a spontaneous emotional condition that was extremely unconscious in its action. He knew he was doing this but did not understand how he went about it. The mechanics were completely unconscious. He was aware that he disliked his mother (opposition = awareness). But he couldn’t see how he translated this into his relations with women in general. And, most important, he had a great deal of trouble doing anything about his problem. The trines made it easy to fall into the pattern, and also difficult to break out of it, while the opposition supplied the energy to create a conflict.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark215">Normally, the combination of hard and soft aspects does not create this type of locked-in position. This is only a possible negative manifestation of the combination. Usually trines serve the positive purpose of giving a stable core to one’s existence, a core that can resist and survive the instability threatened by hard aspects. In fact, the combination of hard and soft aspects is an ideal condition. It was unfortunate in my friend’s case</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that it worked out negatively. Had his mother known earlier in his life that through his relationship with her he would be easily subject to negative programing with regard to women, she might have been able to treat him differently as a child.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Sextile (60°) <span class="p">Since the sextile is based on the division of the circle by six, it is less intense than the trine, and there is also a slight difference in quality. The number six is the product of two times three; thus the sextile shares some qualities with the two-series aspects in that it requires more dynamism to actualize. The sextile is to the trine as the opposition is to the conjunction, and, like the opposition, the sextile often results in an increase of awareness. An even more important difference from the trine is that the sextile usually represents circumstances in which one has to exert some energy in order to take advantage of the situation that is offered. Whereas trines will often signify that matters will work themselves out, with the sextile one has to give assistance. Hence a common keyword for sextiles is “opportunity.”</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">As the sextile requires a bit more effort than the trine to actualize, so it also is not so limiting. It is not as potent a force for maintaining the status quo and is less likely to indicate a person caught in an irrevocable balance. However, like an excess of trines, an excess of sextiles can be an indication of a lack of dynamism in the life and a tendency to adopt a passive attitude toward existence. Also like the trine, the sextile serves as a buffer against excessively rapid change and instability. The overall number of trines together with sextiles can be used as an index of the personality’s ability to withstand stress and disruption without overreacting and losing perspective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In practice, the distinction between sextiles and trines in the natal chart is not very significant. The distinction can be more important when comparing the natal chart to the positions of the planets at a given time after birth (transits). Here, sextile and trine connections may differ.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Semisextile (30°) and Quincunx (150°) <span class="p">It is not generally known that Ptolemy and other Greek writers lumped the semisextile and quincunx together under the term “inconjunct.” It is therefore not, strictly speaking, correct to apply “inconjunct” only to the quincunx as is so often done. The ancient use of the same word for both aspects points up the fact that they are similar. Both are based on the division of the circle by twelve. One would expect some differences between one-twelfth of the circle (the semisextile) and five-twelfths (the quincunx), but they are not great.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Only recently, astrologers have begun to get into clear touch with what these two aspects symbolize. In the past, observers merely noted that</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">they were both based on one-half of a sextile, and they therefore drew the conclusion that both were essentially weak sextiles. This has not turned out to be the case. In fact, the weight of opinion on these aspects has changed from a judgment of weakly benefic to decidedly difficult.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="s31">The problem raised by these aspects is best symbolized by the fact that they unite points in signs that have no relationship to each other. Signs in opposition, square, trine and sextile have many similarities, but signs in semisextile and quincunx have none (see the sections on elements, crosses, and polarities in </a><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="a">Chapter </a>10<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The nature of aspects does not arise out of the relationships among the signs, however. Actually, it is the other way around: the relationships among the signs arise from the numbers that divide the circle into the aspects. But the ambiguous nature of connections based on multiples of thirty degrees is still made clear by this comparison.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Looking at the semisextile and quincunx as based on the number twelve, we discover that twelve equals four times three. As the sextile acquired a little of the opposition’s dynamism from the fact that six equals the product of two and three, so we would expect the semisextile and quincunx to have something of the difficulties of the square. In fact, they seem to.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Semisextiles and quincunxes combine the passive nature of the three-series with the tension and sense of unease typically associated with squares. It might be said that they represent connections between entities that have no logical connection, and there does not seem to be enough energy to change the relationship.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The nature of these aspects can be made even more clear by pointing out that the eighth and the sixth houses derive their meanings from the quincunxes that they form to the first house. Likewise, the second and twelfth houses get their qualities from the semisextiles that they form to the first house. With the exception of the second house, these houses all represent somewhat difficult and ambiguous areas of life in which many people have difficulties.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But the difficulties signified by the semisextile and the quincunx are not the cosmic kinds that make lives into tragedies. They represent tensions and difficulties that are annoying, but usually too trivial and too thoroughly bound up in the fabric of everyday life to be worth changing. The exception to this is that there does seem, according to many investigators, to be a connection between quincunxes and illnesses and death.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark216">A typical dilemma of these two aspects is a forced choice between two conditions, which requires letting go of one entirely and going along</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">with the other. When one tries to make a move, it turns out that one cannot let go of the alternative that has to be relinquished. A quincunx or semisextile between the Sun and Moon, for example, signifies that the emotions and the conscious will do not cooperate smoothly, and that one’s emotional desires are often in conflict with what one has consciously chosen as right. There is a feeling that there are two entities within the self that are completely different, so much so that they don’t even fight with each other. They simply operate as if the other did not exist.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The only resolution that can be suggested for these tensions is to become extremely conscious of the patterns of difficulty themselves and to detach oneself emotionally from them so that one can see them clearly and do whatever is necessary to alter them. The usual problem with these aspects is that their negative effects are so subtle and so bound up in the fabric of one’s being that one cannot clearly see what is happening.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part43.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part45.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
