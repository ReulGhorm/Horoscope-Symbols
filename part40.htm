Unlike the aspects just discussed, however, they are not measured along the ecliptic. Instead, they are measured in terms of angles above or below the equator, the plane of the Earth’s daily rotation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark192">For this and other reasons, they are often neglected by modern astrologers. I used to not pay much attention to them, more through inertia than through testing them and finding them lacking, but I have now begun to watch them, and they do seem to act like major aspects.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Parallels are aspects in declination. The declination is the number of degrees a body is north ( + ) or south ( − ) of the equator. The ecliptic, or Sun’s apparent path through the sky, is tilted to the equator by 23°26’, and therefore the Sun can have a declination of from +23°26’ to − 23°26’. Because the other bodies have orbits not quite in the plane of the ecliptic, they can have declinations of up to about plus or minus 26°.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Simply put, two bodies are in parallel if their declinations are the same, and in contraparallel if they are in opposite declinations. For example, two bodies are in parallel if they both have declinations of +10°, and they are in contraparallel when one has a declination of +10° and the other of —10°.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 248pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="331" alt="image" src="Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark193">Figure 9.

Why measure horizontally with reference to one plane, and vertically with reference to another? The answer is that the parallel and contraparallel are in fact related to the signs of the zodiac, but not in an immediately obvious way.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="s31" name="bookmark194">We are used to thinking of the signs as simply divisions of longitude along the ecliptic, but their basis is actually in declination. The signs begin at 0° Aries, which, if you will remember from </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="a">Chapters </a>2 <a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31">and </a>5<span style=" color: #000;">, is one of the two points where the plane of the ecliptic crosses the plane of the equator. This means that the Sun has 0° declination when it is at 0° Aries. This is the vernal equinox, when the Sun spends an equal time above the horizon as below it, or, in other words, day and night are equal in length. The other point at which the Sun has 0° declination is 0° Libra, the autumnal equinox, or second point in the Sun’s yearly travel where the ecliptic crosses the equator and day equals night. But whereas in Aries the Sun was increasing in declination and the days were getting longer, in Libra the Sun is decreasing in declination and the days are getting shorter.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part40.htm#bookmark193" class="s31">The Sun reaches its extremes of declination at 0° Cancer and 0° Capricorn. At 0° Cancer it is 23°26’ north of the equator, which means that in the Northern Hemisphere the Sun spends its maximum time above the horizon and the day reaches its maximum length. At 0° Capricorn the Sun is 23°26’ south of the equator, resulting in the Northern Hemisphere’s shortest day of the year. See </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark193" class="a">Figure </a>9<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 305pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="407" alt="image" src="Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark195">Figure 10. Parallels and contraparallels</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark196">The twelve signs can be seen as subdivisions of the angles between these means and extremes of declination. While none of the orbital planes of the other planets crosses the equator at precisely 0° Aries, all cross the equator close enough to 0° Aries to give the signs of the zodiac an approximate relation to the declinations of these bodies. Thus, if two bodies are in the same sign of the zodiac, they will also have approximately the same declination and be roughly in parallel. The “day,” or time spent above the horizon by the two bodies, will be about the same length, and if two bodies are in opposite signs, they will have opposite declinations and be roughly in contraparallel. The day of one will be about the same length as the night of the other. In other words, the day-to-night ratio of the two bodies will be reversed. We can see from this that there is in fact a connection between parallels and conjunctions on the one hand and between contraparallels and oppositions on the other.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Declinations and Antiscia <span class="p">But unlike bodies in conjunction or opposition, bodies in parallel or contraparallel do not have to be in the same or opposite signs. There are not one, but two places where a body can be in parallel or contraparallel to another.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For the sake of simplicity, let us again consider the plane of the</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31">ecliptic, which has 0° declination at 0° Aries, reaches its maximum declination at 0° Cancer, and has 0° declination again at 0° Libra. This means that at equal distances on either side of 0° Cancer, this plane has equal declinations. The same is true for the other solstice, 0° Capricorn. Thus two planets will be in parallel not only when they are at about the same point in the zodiac, they will also be in parallel if one of them is about the same number of degrees on the other side of 0° Cancer or 0° Capricorn. In other words, they will be in parallel if one planet is near the antiscion or solstice point of the other (see </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="a">Chapter </a>5 <a href="part40.htm#bookmark195" class="s31">for a fuller discussion of antiscia). And two planets will be in contraparallel not only when one of them is near an opposition to the other, but also when one of them is near the antiscion of the opposition. See </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark195" class="a">Figure </a>10<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part40.htm#bookmark195" class="s31">Looked at another way, two planets can be in contraparallel when they are both the same distance from the equinoxes, 0° Aries or 0° Libra. This is why the Hamburg school considers antiscia to be not only points equidistant on either side of the solstices, but also points equidistant on either side of the equinoxes. Another look at </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark195" class="a">Figure </a>10 <span style=" color: #000;">will make this clearer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Antiscia are thus clearly connected to parallels and contraparallels, but the correspondence is exact only when both of the bodies involved are in the plane of the ecliptic. This, of course, is not usually the case. Most of the time, one or both bodies (unless they are the Sun) will not be exactly on the ecliptic. That is, they will have a celestial latitude other than 0°. When two bodies have latitudes of other than 0°, and are on opposite sides of the solstices or equinoxes, they will not necessarily have their midpoint at exactly 0° Cancer, Capricorn, Aries, or Libra. For this reason, we cannot assume that bodies in each other’s antiscia will always (or even usually) be in an exact parallel or contraparallel.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31" name="bookmark197">This is not to say that antiscia and contra-antiscia are worthless. They consist of planets forming midpoints to the solstices and equinoxes, which, as indicated in </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="a">Chapters </a>5 <a href="part62.htm#bookmark268" class="s31">and </a>9<span style=" color: #000;">, seem to be important sensitive points.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Orbs in Parallels <span class="p">What orb to use when judging whether two bodies are in parallel or contraparallel presents a thorny question. As mentioned earlier, the range of possible declinations is only about plus or minus 26° from the equator, whereas the range of the zodiac is 360°. This implies immediately that the orb of a parallel or contraparallel should be kept relatively small, certainly no more than a degree or so.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 191pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="254" alt="image" src="Image_021.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark198">Figure 11. The Rate of Change of Declination</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part40.htm#bookmark198" class="s31">There is a problem, however in examining </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark198" class="a">Figure </a>11<span style=" color: #000;">, you will discover that as longitude changes near the solstices, declination changes slowly, whereas near the equinoxes, declination changes rapidly. This means that a body is more likely to have a high declination than a declination near 0°. If you use the same orb in all cases, bodies near the solstices will have a much greater probability of being in parallel or contraparallel than bodies near the equinoxes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because of this fact, one authority on parallels, Charles Jayne, recommends changing the orb of a parallel according to its longitude. I am inclined to agree, at least in principle. His method for determining what orb to give a parallel or contraparallel is as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">1. Decide what orb you would use for a zodiacal conjunction or opposition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">2. Take the declination of the first body that you wish to check and, using any year of an ephemeris that lists the Sun’s declination as well as its longitude, find what longitude the Sun would have at that declination.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Do the same for the other body.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">4. If the two bodies have the same longitude equivalent within your established orb (or opposite longitude equivalents in the case of a contraparallel), then you have a parallel (or contraparallel) within orb.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Remember that for any given declination the Sun will have two longitudes, one on either side of the solstice axis. For this test, use the two longitude equivalents that are on the same side of the solstice. For contraparallels, check both longitude equivalents of each body’s declination to see if either member of each pair is in opposition to either of the others.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part40.htm#bookmark199" class="s31">This is admittedly a time-consuming procedure. Using </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark199" class="a">Table 3</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">instead of an ephemeris will save a good deal of page-turning. Here are some examples of how this table is used.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Example 1<span class="p">. Body A has a declination of +22°00’, and body B a declination of +22°42’. The orb we use for conjunctions is 5°. Are these bodies in parallel?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the table we locate the first declination, +22°00’, in the left-hand column. Since it is a north declination, we look for its longitude equivalent in one of the columns headed “North Declinations (+).” We then look in the left-hand column for the second declination, +22°42’, and find its L.E. in the column in which we found the first L.E. It does not matter which column under “North Declinations” we use, so long as we use the same column for both L.E.’s. This is because all the longitudes in one column will be on the same side of the solstice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">For a declination of + 22 °00’ we find a L.E. of 10° II 23’, and for a declination of + 22°42’, we find a L.E. of 16° II 01’. If one allows a 5° orb for a conjunction, this is not a parallel because the L.E.’s are more than 5° apart.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="16" alt="image" src="Image_022.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="16" alt="image" src="Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Example 2<span class="p">. Body A has a declination of +10°00’, and body B a declination of + 11°00’. The L.E. of +10°00’ is 25° 53’, while that of + 11°00’ is 28° 40’. These are well within the 5° orb, and therefore would be in parallel by almost any standard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">The declinations in Example 1 were only 42’ apart and yet the L.E.’s were 5°38’ apart, whereas in Example 2 the declinations were a full degree apart but the L.E.’s were only 2°47’ apart. This illustrates how the declination changes more rapidly as the longitude approaches the equinoxes. <i>Example 3</i>. Body A has declination of +23°12’ and body B a declination of − 22 °48’. Given an orb of 5° for an opposition, are these two</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bodies in contraparallel?</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">In the columns under “North Declinations” we look up both L.E.’s of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="10" height="11" alt="image" src="Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">+ 23°12’ and get 22° II 08’ and 7’ 52’. Then in the columns under “South Declinations” we look up both L.E.’s of − 22°48’ and get 17° 01’ and 12°</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="11" alt="image" src="Image_026.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">59’. As these pairs of L.E.’s are a little more than 5° of being in exact opposition to one another, bodies A and B are not in contraparallel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark199">Table 3</a></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Solar Longitudes Equivalent to Given Declinations</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 600pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="488" height="800" alt="image" src="Image_027.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark200">Whether you use an ephemeris or this table, there is still a serious difficulty with solar longitude equivalents.

Using this method it is impossible to find the L.E. of a declination such as +24° because the Sun never reaches that declination.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The simplest solution is to treat such declinations as if they were in fact 23°26’. The only problem is that it is theoretically possible for both bodies to be above the upper limit (or below the lower limit) and still be over a degree apart in declination.
