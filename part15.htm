Mundane astrology is the astrology of world and other public events, as opposed to the astrology of the individual that I am presenting here. Mundane position, on the other hand, applies to any horoscope, whether public or individual. It is the part of the horoscope that refers to the turning of the world, as opposed to the celestial part that refers to the orbiting of bodies in space. Mundane position tells you which planets are above, and which are below the horizon at any particular point on the surface of the Earth. It also describes what stage of its daily cycle a planet is in: how far it has traveled between rising and culminating (reaching its highest point in the sky), or culminating and setting, or setting and anticulminating (reaching its lowest point in the sky), etc. As with the year cycle, most astrologers divide the day cycle into twelve parts, which in the case of the day cycle are nowadays called the houses. Because it allows you to relate celestial events to the local horizon, mundane position makes it possible to set up an astrological chart for a particular event on Earth, be it the birth of a nation or the birth of an individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39">Mundane position involves the interaction of four different planes: the horizon of the birthplace, the meridian of the birthplace, the equator and the ecliptic. Of these four, the horizon is the principal mundane plane of reference. Every point on the surface of the Earth has its own horizon plane. If you are standing on the Earth holding a weight on a string, that string will point down, in the direction of gravity, approximately to the center of the Earth. The horizon plane will be perpendicular to the string. For you, the</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">30</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">horizon separates above from below. The heavens above the horizon are visible to you, but the heavens below are blocked from view by the Earth you are standing on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The local meridian is perpendicular to the horizon. It goes from the point due south of you on the horizon, up directly overhead, down through the point north of you on the horizon, under your feet, and back to the south point on the horizon. Whenever a planet reaches the upper part of your local meridian, it has reached its highest point in the sky, from your point of view. When a planet reaches the lower part of your local meridian, it has reached its lowest point in the sky. The meridian separates planets that are on their way up from those that are on their way down.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Your local meridian is also perpendicular to the equator, or plane of the Earth’s daily rotation. In fact, all meridians are by definition perpendicular to the equator: a meridian is any great circle that passes through the north and south poles, which are at right angles to the equator. Meridians divide up the sphere of the Earth and the heavens like the sections of an orange. Your local meridian is the one that happens to be passing overhead.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As the Earth turns in the plane of the equator, the relation of the meridian to the fixed stars changes. It is from the motion of your local meridian relative to the fixed stars and other bodies in the sky that you can tell that the Earth is turning. The local meridian is our reference point for telling the time of day. Noon (Latin <i>meridiem</i>) is the time the Sun is near the meridian, and we divide our day into <span class="s32">AM </span>(<i>ante meridiem</i>, “before noon”) and <span class="s32">PM </span>(<i>post meridiem</i>, “after noon”).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ecliptic is important in measuring mundane position chiefly because astrologers have chosen to project mundane positions onto it for the sake of convenience. In this way, the position of everything in the horoscope can be expressed in degrees of celestial longitude. Having one measuring scale for all the symbols greatly simplifies the job of relating one horoscope symbol to another.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, however, projecting mundane positions onto the ecliptic results in a certain degree of distortion. This is because the plane of the ecliptic is rarely perpendicular to the plane of the horizon or of the meridian.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark40">The Horoscope Angles </a><span class="p">Astrologers generally use the term “aspect” for the angular relationships between factors in the horoscope, and reserve the term “angle” for one of the four principal mundane points, the Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven, and I.C. These are the “horoscope angles,” and planets near them on either side or anywhere in the house</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">31</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immediately counterclockwise from them are often called “angular.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The horoscope angles are in part a device for expressing the horizon and meridian planes in terms of degrees along the ecliptic. The Ascendant and Descendant are the two points where the ecliptic crosses the horizon. Planets rise, or pass from below the horizon to above it, at or near the Ascendant. They set, or pass from above the horizon to below, at or near the Descendant. These two points are always exactly 180° from each other.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, the Midheaven and I.C. are always exactly opposite each other. These angles are where the ecliptic crosses the local meridian. The Midheaven (English for the Latin <i>medium coeli</i>) is where these two circles cross above the horizon, and the I.C. (short for <i>imum coeli</i>, or “lowest heaven”) is where they cross below the horizon.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the case of the Sun, which is always exactly on the ecliptic, and of any other planet that happens to be right on the ecliptic at the moment of birth, the horoscope angles are accurate indicators of the body’s mundane position. If the body’s ecliptic longitude is a half degree above the Ascendant, the body will be a half degree above the horizon. But if the body has any celestial latitude (that is, if it is not exactly on the ecliptic), the body’s longitude may be above the horizon while the body itself is below the horizon, or vice versa. And something similar is true of the Midheaven. If the body has latitude, it can actually reach its highest point in the sky before or after its degree on the ecliptic reaches the Midheaven.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The greater a body’s celestial latitude, the less reliable its ecliptic relation to the horoscope angles is likely to be as an indicator of mundane position. The worst case among the planets is Pluto, which can reach a latitude of over 17°. Pluto can appear by ecliptic longitude to be a whole house below the horizon when in reality it is above. And the distortion with fixed stars, which can have latitudes up to 90°, can be extreme. The only times this distortion does not occur with a body that has latitude are those occasional moments when the ecliptic is perpendicular to the horizon or meridian.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part15.htm#bookmark41" class="s31">If you are interested in the geometry of all this, you can refer to </a><a href="part15.htm#bookmark41" class="a">Figure </a>1<span style=" color: #000;">. But it is not necessary to do so. Just remember that if a planet is near an angle or an intermediate house cusp and its latitude shows it to be far from the ecliptic, you should not base your whole interpretation on the fact that it is in the house it appears to be in, or is actually rising, culminating, setting or anticulminating. Handily, some ephemerides and computerized chart calculations list celestial latitudes so you can check them and thus decide how well a planet’s degree on the ecliptic expresses its true relation to the horizon or meridian.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fortunately, the horoscope angles are for most purposes fairly good indicators of how close a planet is to the horizon or meridian. As such, the angles are extremely important. The two points where a planet crosses the horizon (rises and sets) and the two points where it crosses the meridian (culminates and anticulminates) appear to be at or near four peaks in the daily cycle of a planetary energy’s intensity. Both the experience of countless astrologers and the findings of formal research confirm this. Thus a planet close to an angle can stand out from all the other planets and become a dominant theme in a person’s life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 433pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="569" height="577" alt="image" src="Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark41">Figure 1.

By the time</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Ascendant becomes 29° , the Moon is well above the horizon.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark42">The horoscope angles not only bestow intensity on planetary energies, they also seem to exert a qualitative effect. This effect is strongest when planets are conjunct (right next to) the horoscope angles, but it also works when planets are in other aspects or in planetary-picture types of relationship to the angles. So far in this section, I have been talking about the angles as ecliptic-based indicators of mundane position, but as you will recall from the earlier section in this chapter, “Other Points,” the Ascendant and Midheaven also appear to have validity in their own right as sensitive points along the ecliptic. Like other forms of node, they indicate specific areas where planetary energies can manifest, and like all points in the horoscope, they work in aspects along the ecliptic, seemingly independently of the true mundane position of the planets they are aspecting.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">These two ways of using angularity come from different schools of astrology. Today some astrologers, mainly those who use the sidereal zodiac, downgrade the importance of the ecliptic in favor of true mundane positions. For them, “angularity” is simply a measure of planetary strength, and it means closeness to the horizon or meridian, rather than to the point along the ecliptic that is the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, or I.C. To them, mundane position does not affect planets qualitatively, and so it makes no sense to use houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most tropical astrologers today, however, including followers of the Uranian and Cosmobiological schools, work almost entirely along the ecliptic and consider the horoscope angles to have specific meanings. The Uranians and Cosmobiologists see the horoscope angles almost exclusively as sensitive points, and measure the angles’ relationship in ecliptic longitude to everything else in the chart. So extensive is their use of angular relationships among points, that they are usually able to derive sufficient information without using houses. Traditionalists, on the other hand, often de-emphasize the angles as sensitive points, and see them mainly as the cusps of houses one, four, seven and ten, carrying the meanings of those houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In my present approach to astrology, I draw something from all these views. I use the horoscope angles as approximate indicators of whether a planet is on the horizon or meridian, as sensitive points making aspect and planetary-picture-type relationships, and as the fundamental divisions from which the houses are derived.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Houses <span class="p">The horoscope angles divide the chart into four quadrants much as the cardinal points (0° Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn) divide the year and the zodiac into seasons. And as in the</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">zodiac, each of the four main divisions of the mundane cycle is usually further divided into three parts, making a total of twelve. In most house systems the horoscope angles are the same as the cusps of the first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark43">Unlike the divisions of the signs, however, the four mundane quadrants and twelve mundane houses are rarely an equal number of degrees apart when measured along the ecliptic. This is because we are projecting mundane divisions onto the plane of the ecliptic.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I said above that there can be some question as to whether a planet whose longitude is the same as an angle’s is actually on the horizon or meridian, but at least there is no question as to the location of the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, and I.C. themselves. There is, however, a great deal of debate over the position of the house cusps subdividing the quadrants. There are literally dozens of methods of dividing up the ecliptic to represent twelve stages in the mundane cycle, and none of these methods is ideal from all standpoints.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The horoscope angles seem to have some validity as sensitive points that can make aspects, but the intermediate house cusps are not treated by most astrologers in this way. The main exceptions to this seem to be 1) astrologers of the Uranian or Hamburg school, who use aspects to cusps in the Meridian house system and 2) the old formulas for Arabian parts, many of which involve house cusps. I prefer to think of the houses as approximate indications of mundane position, and to use only the horoscope angles as definite points.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like the horoscope angles, the houses represent areas in life where planetary energies can manifest. Although nothing in the chart really represents actual entities that may be experienced in life (persons, objects, etc.), houses come somewhat closer than planets. They are the closest thing to nouns in the chart. Houses represent compartments of the self, the psyche, and the environment as it is acted upon and experienced. They represent the orientation that the energies of the planets have in the individuals life. They describe, at least in part, where energies will surface. If they are somewhat noun-like, they are also much like prepositional phrases that designate from whence, to which, and by whom a planetary energy may be experienced.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31">The problem is that, like planets, houses operate at different levels, and it is difficult to determine exactly which level will be the level of manifestation. Levels of manifestation have little to do with the horoscope itself, but rather with the way the individual is handling it.
