In Aries and Taurus we had the building and animating of the physical body; in Gemini and Cancer we have the development of the mental and emotional aspects of the individual. Gemini represents the mental part.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Gemini is probably the most perfectly mutable of all mutable signs, because there is something inherently mutable about air. Like the wind, the nature of Gemini is to move rapidly from place to place, covering everything it encounters, but perhaps too rapidly to get a deep impression of anything. Preceding Cancer, the first water sign, Gemini is not yet aware that there are deeper aspects of reality that are not immediately amenable to logic and rational analysis. It understands quickly but does not empathize. It</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">228</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">learns quickly but does not develop that deep, feeling understanding of the world that enables some people to live skillfully without really having to think.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Gemini’s compensation for this is its speed and curiosity. It is the first sign to concern itself with the relationships of various elements in the environment. It does not evaluate these relationships, nor does it particularly concern itself with its own relationship to them. It merely wants to know what is going on out there. In this respect, Gemini, the third sign, is often related to the third house. And the relationship <i>is </i>quite close. I seriously question the idea that Gemini has anything to do with brothers and sisters, however, even though the constellation Gemini represents twins (of course, that constellation now occupies the sign Cancer).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Gemini is usually quite sociable, and enjoys meeting people. The sign has a fairly high energy level which other people find refreshing, yet the level is not so high as to be exhausting to those of a slower temperament. Gemini makes even the casual social contact interesting, but when it comes to deeper, more profound connections, the sign is somewhat resistant. It regards strong attachments as confining and feels that they get in the way of its need to range about widely in search of experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Being mutable, Gemini tends, like the wind, to go around obstacles rather than confront them directly. If subjected to really strong pressure, Gemini will simply change. Consistency and constancy may be difficult for Gemini, which loses interest quickly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark368">One aspect of Gemini that has not been stressed in the literature is that it is a sign of game-playing and trickery. It loves card games and mentally oriented board games, and it also enjoys games in the sense of complicated social maneuvers. Gemini’s tricks are not intended so much to deceive or misrepresent as they are mental activities that Gemini enjoys. Unfortunately, Gemini’s lack of empathy and any real understanding of feelings may cause it to hurt others where no hurt was intended.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Gemini to Mercury <span class="p">There are those who maintain that Mercury rules Virgo, and that something else rules Gemini, but I cannot accept that argument. In my opinion the fit between Mercury and Gemini is about as close as possible for a planet-ruler pair. Both the sign and the planet represent the same questing intellectual drive to establish connections between the self and the environment. Such connections are needed to establish common bonds with other people and a relationship to the environment in general. Both sign and planet are predominantly mental and extremely changeable. Both are more concerned with discovering an idea than with making practical use of it. People in whom Mercury is strong</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">often appear similar to those with the Sun in Gemini. I have the Sun closely conjunct Mercury, and, although I do not look like one, people have thought that I am a Gemini more often than they have thought I am a Sagittarius (my Sun sign) or a Cancer (my rising sign). Just as Gemini is the consummate air sign, Mercury is the consummate air planet. The game-playing trickster side of Gemini discussed above is also characteristic of Mercury.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Gemini on Planets <span class="p">In most respects Gemini is the opposite of Taurus. It tends to quicken the energy of planets, and to make them work at a more abstract level. Planets concerned with feeling, emotion, and sensitivity are the ones most negatively affected by Gemini. Among these are the Moon and Neptune. Venus is often fickle in Gemini, but otherwise it is not seriously affected. Slow-acting planets such as Saturn do not seem to be seriously affected by the sign, but they do operate at a higher energy level.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A person with many planets in Gemini is likely to be freedom-loving and possibly lacking in persistence. To make up for the sign’s frequent lack of depth of knowledge, Geminians can cover great amounts of ground very quickly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part88.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part90.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
