I do not feel that dignities have any special value apart from the logical affinities and conflicts that exist between signs and planets. If a planet is said to be dignified in a sign with which it has no obvious affinity, I am not inclined to take the dignity seriously. By the same token, I am not inclined to take the debility of a planet in a sign seriously unless there is some dear conflict between the symbolism of the sign and the planet. I feel that signs are a far less reliable indication of a planet’s cosmic state than are aspects and midpoint combinations.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Moreover, I take the greatest exception to using sign rulerships and planetary exaltations for assigning planetary rulers to houses. Added to what I have already pointed out, there is another telling argument against this technique.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In India, which has the greatest number of astrologers of any country in the world, a sidereal zodiac is most commonly used. Their “Aries” differs from our “Aries” by around 24° to 25°. Where we might have Virgo on a house cusp, for example, the Hindu astrologer would at least five- sixths of the time have Leo. Therefore the rulers of the signs on the cusps would usually be different. Hindu astrologers use planets ruling signs on house cusps exactly as most Western astrologers do, and, if anything, they rely on them even more extensively. Yet a Hindu astrologer reading a chart with sidereal-zodiac rulerships will usually get the same results as a Western astrologer using the tropical zodiac. This means one of two things:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">either house rulerships play only a small part in one or both of the delineation schemes (which is patently untrue at least with the Hindu), or the astrologers involved only think that planets ruling houses are important in their scheme, while they are actually deriving their results intuitively. If either explanation is true, then planetary rulership of house-cusp signs is not a reliable technique without the use of intuition. In both systems, planetary rulership of house-cusp signs seems to be most useful in after-the-fact explanations. If a technique is only useful after the fact, this is a good sign it is not useful at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="161" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_049.png"/></span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark356"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12pt;">*</span></a>Interestingly, however, modern science has come to something very similar to fire, earth, air, and water in the four physical states of matter. Earth corresponds to solids, water to liquids, air to gases, and fire to plasmas (high-energy states of matter in which the atoms are stripped of their electrons).</p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark357"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12pt;">*</span></a>At least one, however, relates air to feeling.
