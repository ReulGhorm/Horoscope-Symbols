These and the horoscope angles—the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, and I.C.—are by far the most important points in the chart.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark29">The Planets </a><span class="p">To modern astronomers, a planet is one of the larger bodies orbiting a star. It is something other than a self-luminous body (a star), a small orbiting body (a planetoid, asteroid, or comet), or a body (a moon or satellite) orbiting a larger non-luminous body. According to this definition, the Earth is a planet, but the Sun is a star and the Moon is for most purposes a satellite.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To astrologers, however, the Sun and Moon are planets, along with Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The Earth is not usually listed as a planet at all. This is because astrology is interested not in an abstract astronomical picture, but in the way things are seen from Earth, that is, from a human perspective. The ancient Greeks gave us the word “planet” from their verb <i>planetein</i>, “to wander.” For astrologers, too, planets are those major heavenly bodies that, alone among the thousands of objects visible in the sky, appear from Earth to move against the background of the fixed stars.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When seen from Earth, the planets all travel in a fairly narrow belt of sky known as the zodiac. This is because, when seen from the Sun, all the planets including the Earth and the Moon have orbits in approximately the same plane. Because the orbital planes are very nearly the same, astrologers find it convenient to measure the progress of all the planets along one plane. For this purpose, they have chosen the plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, which from the Earth appears to be the Sun’s yearly path through the sky. This plane is known as the ecliptic. The terms “zodiac” and “ecliptic” are often used interchangeably, though strictly speaking the ecliptic appears to us as a line and the zodiac is the area surrounding that line. In order to measure the progress of the planets, the ecliptic is divided into 360°, or twelve signs of 30° each. The circle of the horoscope that we draw on paper represents the circle of the ecliptic, and the degrees and minutes of the planets and other points are degrees along the ecliptic, or degrees of celestial longitude. (If we want to measure how far a body is above or below the ecliptic, we do this in degrees of celestial latitude, which are at right angles to degrees of celestial longitude.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If you live in the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere and you view the Sun or Moon at the same hour day after day, they appear to be moving steadily counterclockwise, or from west to east, against the background of the fixed stars. The Sun takes a year to go around the zodiac, while the Moon takes</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part17.htm#bookmark66" class="s31">about 28 days. The other planets move mainly counterclockwise, but from time to time they appear to stop and move clockwise or retrograde before continuing their generally forward progress in the zodiac. (The reasons for retrogradation are given in </a><a href="part17.htm#bookmark66" class="a">Chapter </a>3<span style=" color: #000;">.) Each planet takes a different amount of time to go once around the zodiac, and so the spatial relationship between the planets is constantly changing, giving each day a unique pattern of planets arranged in space.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark30">For this reason, in astrology the planets have come to represent those factors that vary in time and which thus relate to the dynamic components of one’s life. Planets are the most basic astrological symbols. They represent the energies of the personality, all dynamism and process within the psyche, body and environment. They describe change, events, and the living energies within us. They signify growth and development, as well as energies that we use to deal with a particular set of circumstances. In a real sense, planets can be likened to the verbs in a sentence.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Often astrologers speak as if planets can also symbolize specific entities, saying, for example, that the Moon signifies women, or Saturn signifies hard objects, crystals, and the like. Strictly speaking, this is erroneous: planets do not signify actual entities. But there is some truth in the idea. When certain planetary energies are active, one may attract people, things, or situations that embody those planetary energies. It is really the energies that are signified, not the entity embodying those energies. For example, if a woman receives a strong Mars influence, she may encounter strong, domineering males. But she may also encounter domineering females, be domineering herself, or encounter other entities that embody Mars energy. The real issue is ego energies, not the entities that embody them. So even though certain kinds of entities usually go with certain planets, planetary energies will often show up in other ways. This is one of the things that makes astrological prediction difficult.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is one branch of astrology in which planets are routinely spoken of as things. This is horary astrology, the astrology of answering specific questions. This is the part of astrology closest to fortunetelling, and it relies heavily on the intuition of the interpreter. But even in horary, planets only represent objects insofar as the objects exhibit the particular energy patterns of the planets that signify them. It is only the speech and writing habits of horary practitioners that make it seem otherwise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another essential point: the planets as representations of energies do not signify the objective reality of what one encounters. They signify the energies as they are experienced. Thus if, due to conditions in the natal chart, a man tends to attract women who seem strong-willed, he may</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">24</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">experience even a relatively weak-willed woman as strong-willed. And he may be the only one who does so with a particular woman. In such a case, his observations about this woman will not be reinforced by other people’s observations. In most cases, a person’s experience of another will be shared by others—but not always. Astrology is a guide to the nature of a person’s experience, and knowing what that experience is is absolutely essential to a psychological understanding of the individual.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Other Points <span class="p">Some of the other point-like categories of symbols are much like planets. The asteroids, planetoids like the newly-discovered Chiron, and even the hypothetical planets of the Uranian and other schools of astrology behave like planets in that they are bodies orbiting against the background of the fixed stars. Like the principal planets, these represent various kinds of energy.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark31">Fixed stars, though they do not travel in orbits, are also bodies in space. According to most authorities they are at least somewhat planet-like in the role they play in the horoscope.</a></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31">But points like the Ascendant, Midheaven, Vertex, East Point, 0° Aries, and the lunar and planetary nodes are not bodies in space. Rather, they are places where another important plane crosses the plane of the ecliptic. These points are less like energies and more like places where energies can manifest. In </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="a">Chapter </a>5<span style=" color: #000;">, I discuss these symbols as points, but I bring up the Ascendant and Midheaven again later in the book because they, along with the houses, are also indicators of the planets’ mundane positions, or positions in relation to a specific point on Earth. The East Point and Vertex reflect mundane position, too, but are discussed only under “Other Points” because they are not basic markers of mundane positions in the way that the Ascendant and Midheaven are.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are also points in the horoscope that are derived from the angular relationships of the points mentioned above. All of these can be grouped under the heading “planetary pictures.” They include midpoints, Arabian parts, and antiscia or solstice points. These points could also be discussed in the section on angular relationships, and, in fact, in the main text of this book I do discuss midpoints more fully there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part11.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part13.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
