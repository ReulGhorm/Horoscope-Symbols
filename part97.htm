In Aries we started with the most purely individualistic assertion of the self. After building up the various aspects of the self and then socializing those aspects, we arrive at Aquarius, where socialization is completed.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aquarius is the sign of the individual as a cooperative unit of the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">group. It is a sign in which, theoretically at least, the individual ego and its needs are subordinated to those of the larger social unit of which the individual is a part. I say theoretically, because what actually happens is often quite different.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is true that Aquarius is at its best as part of some kind of social grouping, just as Libra is at its best as part of a couple. Aquarians are gregarious and enjoy social interactions. They value friendships, and respect what group effort can do. It is as if no activity has meaning to an Aquarian unless it has a social dimension. But just as the Libran tends to be the dominant person in a relationship, the Aquarian tends to be the dominant member of a group. Like Librans, Aquarians need social interaction in order to define themselves, but having done so they are strong individuals who tend to dominate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In order to understand Aquarius, one has to recall that it is opposite Leo. Leo is the sign of the completed individual, strong and self-confident on her or his own. The ego is fully or even overly developed. Aquarius is the sign of the completely socialized ego. Its ego is just as strong as Leo’s, but whereas Leo takes its sense of self from awareness of self alone, Aquarius takes its awareness of self from the group and identifies the interests of the group as its own. If Leo says, “I am grand and magnificent in myself,” Aquarius says, “I am nothing except that I am the embodiment of what society wants.” Putting it another way, Leo when egotistical is overtly so; Aquarius is more likely to be covertly egotistical. This does not mean that all Aquarians are covert egotists, it means simply that Aquarians derive their sense of ego from an identification with something external to themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Paradoxically, this socially oriented sign can produce radical or innovative thinkers who seem highly individualistic and self-sufficient and do not seem to need the approval of society at all. But actually, even if the Aquarian radical or reformer does not need to be tied to society as a whole, he or she always needs some kind of group with which to identify. Usually that group thinks it is a truer embodiment of society than is the prevailing social order. Also, most of the radical ideals that an Aquarian might hold have social consequences. Aquarius is not content merely to perfect itself; it desires to perfect all of society. Though it is an intensely freedom-loving sign, the freedom it loves is the freedom to change all of society to what it thinks society should be. It is not happy letting others have their freedom if their view of freedom differs from its own. It is, after all, a fixed sign, and no matter how radical (or conventional, for that matter) its ideas are, once they are arrived at, they do not change easily.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A real problem for Aquarius comes from both its social orientation and its being an air sign. Aquarians tend to have strong social ideals about how people ought to be, but they do not relate easily to individual people except perhaps insofar as they embody social issues. Aquarius is the sign of the humanitarian who loves all mankind but no individual human being. Being an air sign, it is not especially at home in the emotional give-and-take of a close personal relationship: Aquarians are more at home with friendship than with love.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I have dwelt on the problematical aspects of Aquarius to counteract the propaganda in recent literature about the coming (or already-here, depending on whom one reads) Aquarian age, in which all the social ills of the Piscean Age are to be miraculously redressed. If the coming age is really Aquarian, it may be an era in which individual considerations, emotional ties of love, and bonds of tradition are ruthlessly rooted out in favor of various utopian orders that are conceived entirely in the head and not at all in the heart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, Aquarius does have many strengths. Being an air sign, it has a detached and fair-minded view of things. It genuinely concerns itself with the good of all, not merely its own good. It is an idealistic sign, with a strong commitment to what it believes. It is also unusually free of restraints imposed by the past and tradition (an attribute that has both good and bad sides).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark391">Aquarius’s main flaw is that it commits itself to society, something that is actually no more real than the individual. In fact, it is less real: society is nothing more than an organized collection of individuals. And the level of organization that exists in society is not yet complex enough for any society to have an organic existence of its own. That is, a society is not a living entity in the same way that an individual is. Insofar as society is a valid entity necessary for the maintenance of human life, the identification of the Aquarian with some form of social order is valid. But insofar as society is an abstract entity with no real organic existence, this identification is damaging. It remains for Pisces to make the real and universally valid identification with something beyond the self.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Aquarius to Uranus and Saturn <span class="p">In my opinion, Aquarius and Uranus make one of the worst sign-ruler parallels. Uranus is trans-social and trans-egoic. Highly individualistic, it is even anti-social much of the time. More truly freedom-loving than Aquarius, Uranus is more willing than Aquarius to grant freedom to others’ different ideas. And whereas Aquarius is fixed, Uranus is unstable and mutable, needing constant change.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are some similarities, however. Both Aquarius and Uranus are airy, though I believe Uranus has some fire in it as well. Both are inclined to radical, innovative ideas. Both tend to be ruthless and unfeeling in their pursuit of right. Neither is an especially warm or emotional symbol.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is also a Saturnine side to Aquarius. Saturn, the traditional ruler of Aquarius, is much more fixed than Uranus. In a way that Uranus is not, Saturn is oriented to society as opposed to the individual. Like both Aquarius and Uranus, Saturn does not handle emotion well. But Saturn is otherwise very earthy and is not fond of abstractions to the extent that Aquarius and Uranus are. Aquarius’s symbolism seems to reflect a mix of Saturn and Uranus, rather than one or the other.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Aquarius on Planets <span class="p">Aquarius is most beneficial to planetary energies that are airy and/or socially oriented. Airy Mercury and socially oriented Jupiter are well placed in Aquarius. So is Saturn, for the reasons discussed above.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although the Sun is traditionally in its detriment in Aquarius, there does not seem to be any serious problem for the Sun here, though of course its expression is not allowed to be so self-centered. The same is true of Mars, which, while not especially badly placed in Aquarius, does have a more social expression here than it does elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Emotional planets such as Venus and the Moon have more difficulty in Aquarius. Venus here tends toward pal-ship rather than love, and the Moon is caught in a struggle between its natural emotionalism, its attachment to the past and what is familiar, and the emotional dryness of the sign. A Moon in Aquarius may or may not be troubled, but it is almost never a typical Moon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part96.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part98.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
