Originally, in Mesopotamia, the land from which astrology as we now practice it was derived, astrology was a system of celestial omens by which the fate of the king and his people was judged. If any individual was involved, it was the king alone. Even he was involved only as he represented the fortunes of his people. Not only was the individual considered too unimportant for astrological investigation, there was also no technique by which the indications of the heavens could be personalized to the individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">By the late Babylonian period, however, just before Alexander invaded the East, astrologers were beginning to use factors that can be applied to individuals. One of these was the rising degree, or at least the rising constellation. What is rising can change more rapidly than any other astrological indication in the heavens, and hence can mark the particular moment in time (and place on Earth) of the birth of a single individual. The rising sign or degree was called the “watcher of the hour,” or <i>horoscopos </i>in Greek. “Horoscope” thus originally meant only what we now call the Ascendant; much later, in the Renaissance, it came to mean the entire chart erected for a specific time and place. This usage stands today.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The horoscope has been from the very beginning a tool for the study of <i>individuality</i>. Without relating the motions of the heavenly bodies to a specific time and place on Earth, you have no personal indication at all, only a general one that applies to everyone on the planet born on a particular day.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark19">Astrology still deals with historical cycles and the fates of nations, but what this book treats is the study of individuals and what they are, with all that implies. Individual astrology is not merely a study of what will</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">happen to people in the course of their lives. It is a study of the whole human life and everything about it: birth, childhood, relationships throughout life, self-image, the images projected onto others, the calling (in both the highest and most mundane sense of the word), the feelings, and the patterns of energy that one generates around oneself. In the final analysis, the study of the horoscope is the study of almost everything about human beings with which one could possibly be concerned.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">No one astrologer can be expected to master all of this, but even with some degree of specialization, astrology is obviously a study that requires the greatest possible depth and breadth of knowledge, wisdom, and experience. Do not let this discourage you: what else were you planning to do with your life, anyway? Besides, the needed knowledge, wisdom, and experience are not learned in school. Rather, they are acquired from living life consciously and with understanding. They may also be acquired from doing astrology: the study of astrology feeds itself. Studying astrology can bring the higher perceptions that life requires.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But acquaintance with astrologers reveals there are at least as many unenlightened and unconscious people in this field as in any other. Astrology by itself does not lead to understanding. One has to start from a viewpoint that will enable one to create a greater understanding of life. To do this, one must be willing to suspend belief in some concepts by which one has been structuring the world, and to look at the world and one’s involvement in it in a different light. One must be willing to stop playing certain games that one has been playing, and instead to deal with the world as honestly and as openly as possible. Also, one has to be willing to expand one’s view of the individual human being.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part7.htm">The Author’s Viewpoint</a><a class="toc0" href="part8.htm">Levels of Manifestation</a><a class="toc0" href="part9.htm">Astrology and Religion</a><a class="toc0" href="part10.htm">The Role of the Symbols</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part5.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part7.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
