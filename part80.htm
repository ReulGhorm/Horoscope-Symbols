The symbolism of the crosses or quadruplicities is not as deep and rich, nor does it cover as many facets of the individual. Yet the crosses are important, partly because they represent three different modes of creativity. These three modes are: <i>cardinal</i>, which symbolizes initial creation, the impetus to create, and the making of beginnings; <i>fixed</i>, which symbolizes the sustaining of what has already been created, and the creation of stability; and <i>mutable</i>, which symbolizes the alteration, transformation, and adaptation of what has already been created.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When events have been initiated from outside, the three</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">quadruplicity types also relate to modes of reaction. <i>Cardinal </i>reaction is counteraction, the making of a second initiative to counter the first. <i>Fixed </i>reaction is resistance, the effort to endure in the face of external initiative, and to avoid change. Again, the emphasis is on stability. <i>Mutable </i>reaction does not actively resist what is happening, but tries to alter it indirectly by bending the course of events onto a desired path.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The crosses are also important because when combined with the elements they distinguish each of the twelve signs from every other. Thus each sign is a unique combination of element and cross: there is only one cardinal water sign (Cancer), one mutable fire sign (Sagittarius), and so forth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark334">This means that in each elemental triangle, there is one cardinal, one fixed, and one mutable sign. Looking at the element earth, for example, earth action and life receive their impetus from Capricorn (the cardinal earth sign), are sustained in Taurus (the fixed earth sign), and are transformed, altered, and sometimes made transcendent by the symbolism of Virgo (the mutable earth sign). More specifically, Capricorn desires to build and to achieve on the material plane; Taurus desires to have, to hold, and also to enjoy the material stability resulting from Capricorn’s action; and Virgo wishes to change and make more effective the products of the material world created by Capricorn and sustained by Taurus.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the water element, the cardinal sign, Cancer, symbolizes the reaching out of feeling and emotion, the desire to encounter the world on a feeling level. Cancer also reaches out to create and nourish new life. The fixed sign, Scorpio, prefers to dwell deep within the inner world of emotion to experience and understand this realm as thoroughly as possible. The mutable sign, Pisces, uses that understanding to bring about a transformation of the self through losing the ego and surrendering the soul.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the air element, Libra, the cardinal sign, brings about an understanding of the simplest kind of relationship, the one-to-one, and symbolizes the beginning of awareness through the creation of a relationship between the self and the other. The fixed sign, Aquarius, symbolizes the effort to understand the relation of everything and everyone to everything else without centering that understanding on the self or limiting the experience to one-to-one relationships. (This view of Aquarius leads logically to some conflicts with popular view of the sign.) The mutable sign, Gemini, takes the understanding of the relation of everything in the universe and attempts to build systems of understanding on the foundations laid by Libra and Aquarius.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the fire element, Aries, the cardinal sign, represents the first out-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">thrusting of Will into the universe. In many ways it is the ultimate cardinal sign. The fixed sign, Leo, represents the will now established within the universe, regarding itself and being regarded by others. In the mutable sign, Sagittarius, that same will tries to re-create and transform the world based on its inner desires and understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">These portrayals of the signs only by element and cross are limited, because there are additional factors that give the signs their individual meanings. Some of these factors, like the polarities and the individual versus the social signs, are known and will be discussed in this chapter. Others are not known, and their presence can only be inferred from the way the actual manifestations of the signs depart from the formulas outlined here.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Crosses and the Seasons <span class="p">What follows is neither proof nor justification of the qualities of the quadruplicities. It is merely an illustration of their relationship to a natural phenomenon, the changing of the seasons in the temperate zones of the world.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark335">The first third of each season is a cardinal sign: in this period the qualities of that season are asserted strongly. It is a period of dynamic change as the new season takes hold upon the Earth. The new season is often in conflict with the one that preceded it, but eventually it triumphs.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The second third of each season is a fixed sign. Here we have the qualities of that season stabilized and most perfectly represented. The weather has settled down and is reasonably predictable.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The last third of each season is the mutable sign. Here the qualities of the season are giving way to those of the next. Again, we have dynamism, but it is the dynamism of something giving way to something else, rather than that of something asserting itself.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Psychological Qualities of the Crosses <span class="p">Like the elements, the crosses or quadruplicities each suggest a type of personality.</span></h4><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Cardinal<span class="p">. As we have already pointed out, the essential nature of the cardinal signs is to initiate action. This does not mean cardinal signs are especially aggressive or assertive. Aries may be quite aggressive, but Cancer is not at all so. It is simply that each cardinal sign represents in its own way the first manifestation of its elemental quality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The chief psychological quality in cardinal signs is a fondness for starting things, often without regard to sustaining them in the future or planning for future growth. The pure cardinal type is extremely active but not very persistent. Cardinal types often start projects without finishing them. As soon as a project is able, at least to some extent, to continue of its own accord, the pure cardinal type loses interest. On the plus side, cardinal</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">types are not daunted by a lack of precedent for whatever they do. This quality applies mainly to issues related to the element involved. For example, Cancer is often conservative in areas not relating to water, though in the area of human feelings it is quite willing to go out and initiate an emotional contact (unless, of course, other factors in the chart indicate that the individual is insecure about encountering people). Likewise, Capricorn may be conservative in thought, but eager to take the initiative in action on the physical plane.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In evaluating the cardinality of an individual as a whole, the planets must be taken into consideration. Planets themselves are not especially cardinal, fixed, or mutable, but certain planets are so strongly aggressive about taking the initiative that they will do so routinely regardless of the quadruplicity. Mars, Uranus, and the Sun have this tendency. Pluto also does in a subtler way.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark336">Fixed</a><span class="p">. As we have said, the fixed signs have the function of preserving and sustaining. But fixity is not conservatism; rather, it fulfills the need for activity to be carried on daily in a predictable and reliable manner. Aquarius, though definitely fixed, is not in the least conservative. Aquarian types may come to radical conclusions about the world, but, once formed, their ideas are not changed. (See the article in the next chapter on Aquarius.) Taurus, on the other hand, is genuinely conservative, while Scorpio and Leo may be anywhere on the spectrum.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The most obvious characteristic of the fixed signs is stubbornness and persistence. What cardinal starts, fixed continues. The fixed signs give existence some degree of stability. The difficulty is that the fixed type may not allow change when it becomes absolutely necessary. At this point fixity can be a barrier to progress.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mutable<span class="p">. Exactly as their name implies, the mutable signs are involved with change, transformation, and adaptation. They symbolize the flexibility needed to allow structures to survive amid changing realities. As a consequence, people in whom mutable signs are prominent are more adaptable and less resistant to change. They may not always initiate change, but they coexist with it well. And on one level, they do initiate change: they are able to take whatever has been created and sustained by the other two quadruplicities and transmute it so it can operate on a higher level.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Interestingly, all four mutable signs have to do with some aspect of knowledge or consciousness. Gemini is ordinary consciousness and thought; Virgo is the knowledge of the physical world that can enable one to use it more effectively; Sagittarius is the broad overview that enables one to fit every part into a whole; and Pisces is the knowledge that comes only when</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the intellect is surrendered to the experience of the One.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part79.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part81.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
