In </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a>12 <span style=" color: #000;">and again later in this chapter I mention how Gauquelin’s studies have called into question the traditional ideas about angular houses. There is also the fact that, of all the symbol systems in astrology, the houses have the most simple-minded, fortunetelling-oriented meanings, meanings that are an embarrassment to any psychological- or philosophical-minded astrologer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the face of all these difficulties, some astrologers have jettisoned</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">houses altogether. The sidereal astrologer Arthur H. Blackwell refers to house division as “heavenly surreal-estate” and, like many other siderealists, uses only the horoscope angles. The Ebertins in Germany have also devised a system that does without houses and works quite well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark444">Although I do not yet reject houses, if the way should become clear I am prepared to reinterpret what they are in a way that would amount to a rejection of house doctrine as it is now. I am particularly willing to accept the idea that there are not twelve houses or any other number of discrete houses. What seems more likely is a continuum, in which signification changes gradually from area to area.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">For the time being, however, I do use houses, for the following reasons. First, the position of the planets with respect to the horizon is clearly very important. At present, other than houses, there is no existing tradition of meaning for dealing with this. Although houses may not give a completely accurate picture of planetary relationships to the horizon, they are a helpful approximation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Second, as I hope to show in the next two chapters, it is possible to make enough sense out of traditional house meanings to attain a fairly profound understanding of human beings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part106.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part108.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
