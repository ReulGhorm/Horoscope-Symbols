Planetary-picture type points can be found either by calculation using the formulas given below or without calculation using the dial techniques given in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter </a>8<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Arabian Parts <span class="p">Despite their name, Arabian parts date back at least to the Greeks, and they were also used in Renaissance Europe as well as by the Arabs. In the form that most astrologers use them today, they are similar to Uranian planetary pictures, and hence they are included here. Arabian parts have gained some articulate proponents in modern times, though most astrologers today do not use the large number of Arabian parts that have been devised. Many, however, use the Part of Fortune routinely.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Part of Fortune is found by adding and subtracting the positions of the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant. In the usual modern method of calculating this part, the longitudes (degrees and minutes within a sign) of these points are first converted to 360° notation (see page 155) and then combined thus: Moon + Ascendant − Sun = Part of Fortune. The longitude of the Part of Fortune is then converted from 360° to sign notation and entered in the chart. All the other Arabian parts are formed using the same A + B − C = D formula with other combinations of points. For example, Ascendant + Venus</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">– Sun = Part of Love; Ascendant + Venus – seventh-house cusp = Part of Divorce. The traditional parts include the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Midheaven, or an intermediate house cusp as at least one of the factors, but it is possible to combine any three horoscope factors in this way, and some modern astrologers have done so.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The method given above is only the simplest of several possible ways of calculating Arabian parts. Wilson’s <i>Dictionary of Astrology </i>gives several older and more complicated methods for calculating the Part of Fortune using oblique ascensions and right ascensions rather than the celestial longitudes (degrees along the ecliptic) that most of us are accustomed to. At the latitude of, say, New York City, the complicated methods can yield results that differ from the results of the more familiar method by as much as 30°, and there will be an even larger discrepancy at higher terrestrial latitudes. Whether or not any of the more complicated methods of calculating the Part of Fortune and other Arabian parts is more valid than the easier method is a question that needs more research and is beyond the scope of this book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whatever coordinate system is used for calculating Arabian parts, using them extensively can create a bewildering array, at the rate of several new points per degree. One runs the danger of being able to devise parts that will prove anything one wishes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">102</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark127">Even if one only uses the Part of Fortune, I am doubtful of its meaning, at least when it is calculated using celestial longitudes. It is said to bestow grace, luck, or favor upon the individual. Being quite lucky, and having my Part of Fortune conjunct Saturn in the twelfth house (a combination that would not normally be considered fortunate), I am understandably skeptical.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 289pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="374" height="385" alt="image" src="Image_012.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -38pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark128">Figure 5.

The main difference between planetary pictures and Arabian parts calculated along the ecliptic is that the Uranians have extended the principle systematically to include all points in the chart (but intermediate house cusps are not usually used). This has the potential of producing an array of extra points as great if not greater than the array of Arabian parts. But most Uranian astrologers are aware of this danger and are trying to create a system for arranging these points into a hierarchy so that clear distinctions can be made as to what is and is not significant.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As compared with Arabian parts, Uranian planetary pictures have meanings that follow much more logically from the symbols involved. For example, the same combination that makes up the Part of Fortune, Ascendant</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">+ Sun − Moon, is delineated by the Uranians as close connections with others (Ascendant), the body or physical well-being (Sun), and women (Moon). Put together, this spells close physical relationships with women in one’s daily life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Given ten planets, the Ascendant, Midheaven, and North Node, the number of possible three-factor combinations in a chart is immense. The way I work, I prefer to limit my use of such combinations to midpoints, which are a special case of planetary pictures in which a sensitive point is formed using two other points instead of three. I feel that all points of the form A + B − C = D (in which A, B, and C are all different) are less significant than midpoints, and that therefore they can be safely dispensed with, at least until the hierarchies of significance mentioned above are created and stabilized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 304pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="355" height="405" alt="image" src="Image_015.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -40pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark129">Figure 6.

Like the planetary pictures discussed above, it involves</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">three factors, but, like midpoints, it has only two <i>different </i><a href="part35.htm#bookmark129" class="s31">factors. This type takes the form C + C − A = B. Using C as the axis, we look at the point on the opposite side of C from A but separated by the same angle. If A is C plus the angle, then the sensitive point, B, is C minus the angle. (See </a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark129" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">6</span>.) I have not personally investigated planetary pictures of this type, but others consider them valuable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 303pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="348" height="404" alt="image" src="Image_016.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark130">Figure 7.

(See </a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark130" class="a">Figure </a>7<span style=" color: #000;">.) Cosmobiologists would express this as A/B = C.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">Using thirteen factors, the number of possible midpoints is less than a hundred, and there are rules for distinguishing their relative importance (see page 168) so that one is not buried in detail. I find that midpoints add new information to a chart, and I use them routinely. The rationale for them, how to use them, and how to delineate them are therefore treated at length in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapters </a>8 <a href="part62.htm#bookmark268" class="s31">and </a>9<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antiscia or Solstice Points <span class="p">Used by the Arabs in the Middle Ages,</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">antiscia have in modem times been resurrected by two independent movements: the Uranian astrologers, who call them antiscia, and more traditional astrologers, who call them solstice points, which is a good way of describing what they are.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part35.htm#bookmark132" class="s31" name="bookmark131">An antiscion is another example of the type of planetary picture described above, in which two factors create a third sensitive point that is not a midpoint. But here the first of the two factors is always either 0° Cancer or 0° Capricorn, which are the summer and winter solstices. Therefore all antiscia have the form A + B − 0° Cancer = 0° (of course, 0° Capricorn may be substituted for 0° Cancer). In other words, 0° Cancer- Capricorn is the midpoint between any point and its antiscion. (See </a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark132" class="a">Figure 8</a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark132" class="s31">, overleaf.) Like the midpoints, antiscia have the formula A + B − C = </a>C, expressed as 270 + 270 − A = B, 270 + 270 − B = A, or A + B − 270 = 270.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="17" height="15" alt="image" src="Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Antiscia closer to 0° have the formulas 90 + 90 − A = B, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 309pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="532" height="412" alt="image" src="Image_018.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark132">Figure 8. Antiscia</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To calculate an antiscion, first convert all longitudes in the formula to 360° notation as explained on page 155. Thus 0° Cancer will become 90° and 0° Capricorn will become 270°. Then, given a planet or angle at <i>y</i>° (in 360° notation), its antiscion will be at 90° + 90° − <i>y</i>°, or at 270° + 270° − <i>y</i></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">°. You can then convert from 360° notation back to sign notation to enter the antiscion on the chart.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">According to the users of these points, the meaning of an antiscion is the same as that of the planet itself. But this is not entirely logical. As stated above, the midpoint between any point and its antiscion is 0° Cancer- Capricorn, and this, of course, is in square to the 0° Aries point mentioned above. As will be explained in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter </a>8<span style=" color: #000;">, points that are in square or opposition aspect to each other are in Uranian astrology and Cosmobiology treated as virtually the same point. From this it follows that antiscia are in fact nothing more than part of that set of planetary pictures that includes the Aries point. Thus, antiscia include not only the symbolism of the planet or angle involved, but also the symbolism of the Aries point, and they should be delineated accordingly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark133">Transiting planets can make aspects to the antiscion of any body. This may seem strange until you realize that the transiting factor on or in aspect to the antiscion is merely forming a midpoint on the Aries axis with the planet whose antiscion is involved. Although I do not use such transits, there is abundant evidence that they can be significant. I suspect, however, that such transits are less important than direct transits to natal factors.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I have not used antiscia extensively except in the form of midpoints involving the Aries axis. I do not use them because I believe it is not desirable to add more points to the chart unless they give information unavailable otherwise. If they merely duplicate, they should be dispensed with.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part34.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part36.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
