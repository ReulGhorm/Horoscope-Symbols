To see what nodes are, imagine that everything in the sky is projected onto the inside of a sphere, much like a planetarium dome, except that it surrounds us on all sides, not just the top. This is the celestial sphere. The center of the sphere represents the center of the Earth, and all the planes we will be talking about will pass through this center. The boundaries of the planes will be at</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the surface of the sphere, and will thus be great circles (as opposed to small circles, which represent the boundaries of planes that do not go through the center of a sphere).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part32.htm#bookmark114" class="s31">In </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark114" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">4</span>, one of the great circles is the ecliptic, or the apparent yearly path of the Sun through the sky. Points <i>N </i>and <i>S </i>are the nodes, where the circle of the ecliptic is intersected by the circle of another plane. Point <i>N </i>is a north, or ascending, node, where the path of the body represented by the other great circle is crossing the ecliptic headed in the general direction of the Earth’s North Pole. Point <i>S </i>is a south, or descending node, where the path of the body is headed toward the South Pole.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The dashed line connecting the nodes <i>N </i>and <i>S </i>is called the nodal axis. The intersection of two planes is always a straight line, and nodes of this type are always exactly 180° apart along the ecliptic. Thus, unless we are talking about planets right at, or conjunct, one of the nodes, any angular relationship to one end of the nodal axis will be similar to its relationship to the other end. For this reason, we usually only need to consider aspects and other angular relationships to one of the pair. By convention, this is usually the north node.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Ascendant and Midheaven <a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">The Ascendant and Midheaven were defined </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="s31">in </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="a">Chapter </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">2 </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">and will be discussed much more fully in </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter 12 </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">as markers of a planet’s mundane position. I mention them here only </a><span class="p">in their roles as nodes and as sensitive points that lie along the ecliptic, forming various angular relationships along the ecliptic to other points in the horoscope.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Ascendant and Midheaven are considered the principal ends of their respective nodal axes, even though both are exceptions to the rule above about the principal end usually being the north node upon the ecliptic. The Ascendant is the north node of the ecliptic upon the horizon, meaning that in this case the horizon is the plane of reference and it is the ecliptic that is crossing the horizon in a northward direction rather than the other way around. The Midheaven changes its angle to the ecliptic so that at one time of day it could be called a north node and another time it could be called a south node. For this reason, it is defined simply as the ecliptic-meridian node that is above the horizon.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As with the other nodes, speaking of one end of the axis implies the whole axis. Thus, whatever I will say below about the Ascendant implies the Descendant also, and whatever I say about the Midheaven includes the I.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark117">When the Ascendant and Midheaven are used as sensitive points, we take aspects to them quite seriously, regardless of the distance off the</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">92</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ecliptic of the body being aspected. Thus if, for instance, Pluto and the Ascendant have the same longitude (in other words, are conjunct) along the ecliptic, the symbols of Pluto and Ascendant-Descendant are considered to be linked, even though Pluto may be nowhere near the horizon (see page 30). The same is true when Pluto makes any other significant angular relationship along the ecliptic to the Ascendant-Descendant axis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Ascendant and Midheaven are special among all points in the chart, for two reasons. One reason is that, unlike the other points, the Ascendant and Midheaven, both being derived from the horizon of a specific point on Earth, depend on the place of birth. The other reason is that the Ascendant and Midheaven are the fastest-moving points in the horoscope. Whereas the planets take from about one to several hundred years to go once around the zodiac, the Sun takes one year, and the Moon takes one month, the Ascendant and Midheaven take only one day. Each moves along the ecliptic on the average of one degree for every four minutes of time. Because they indicate both the place and the time of the birth down to the minute, the Ascendant and Midheaven are what links conditions in the heavens to a particular individual on Earth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traveling at the speed they do, they are in a constantly changing relationship to all the other points in the horoscope, highlighting one group of planets at one time, and then another group a few minutes later. Thus the horoscope of a person born at eight o’clock can be quite different from that of another born the same day at eight-thirty.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">In </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapters </a>12 <a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">and </a>15 <span style=" color: #000;">I will describe in detail how the Ascendant and Midheaven derive their meanings from their position in the mundane cycle. Here, however, it suffices to outline their signification using a few keywords.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part62.htm#bookmark268" class="s31">A key idea for the Ascendant-Descendant axis is “exchange with the environment.” Planets in a significant angular relationship to this axis generally manifest in relationships and in a person’s interaction with the outside world. The Midheaven-I.C. axis, on the other hand, signifies how one feels inwardly (I.C.) and expresses oneself outwardly (Midheaven), or where in life one is coming from and going to. The key idea here is “I, me, mine”: this axis has less to do with relationships and more to do with one’s sense of oneself. Examples of how the Ascendant and Midheaven work in combination with planetary energies can be found in the brief midpoint delineations of pairs of points in </a><a href="part62.htm#bookmark268" class="a">Chapter </a>9<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Intermediate House Cusps <a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="s31">As mentioned in </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">2</span><span class="p">, because the position of house cusps other than the horoscope angles is a matter of continuing debate, I do not consider aspects to intermediate house cusps or</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">93</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">use them as sensitive points in any way. Only a few astrologers, such as those of the Uranian school or those who use Arabian parts extensively, use house cusps as sensitive points in the chart.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark118">The Vertex </a><span class="p">We have seen that the Ascendant and Midheaven axes are created by the intersection of the ecliptic plane with the horizon and meridian planes. The horizon divides the chart into up and down, whereas the meridian divides it into east and west (or, if you prefer, left and right). There is also a plane that divides the celestial sphere into front and back. It runs at right angles to the meridian, east and west directly over our heads and under our feet, and it is called the prime vertical.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Theoretically, the points where this circle crosses the ecliptic ought also to have meaning. So postulated L. Edward Johndro, a technically proficient astrologer from New York, some decades ago. His work led him to conclude that the intersection in the west is the more important, and he named that point the Vertex (and the opposite point in the east the Antivertex). He and his students, among them Charles Jayne, have found that the Vertex has to do with fateful and important encounters, either with people or circumstances. I mentioned the Vertex in <i>Planets in Composite</i>. Since then I have examined it further and still do not have a clear idea of its usefulness. What does emerge is that it is most active in situations that are dramatic and not characteristic of one’s ordinary life. This would seem to accord with Johndro’s and Jayne’s ideas, but I do not find it useful in most cases. Other astrologers have had different experiences; clearly more work is needed.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The East Point <span class="p">Another new horoscope angle that has received attention lately is the so-called East Point. In fact, it does not represent any point on the ecliptic that is due east (that point is the Antivertex). The East Point should be called the Equatorial Ascendant, because it is the degree of the zodiac that would be rising if one were born on the equator.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The East Point has been put forth as akin to the Ascendant, but its precise meaning has never been clearly stated so as to distinguish it from the Ascendant in a way that astrologers can agree upon. Because its meaning is not clearly formulated, its effectiveness cannot be tested; if you make the meaning of a symbol vague enough and use large enough orbs you can make anything work. For these reasons I am not an advocate of the East Point.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Lunar Nodes <span class="p">The lunar nodes are those degrees in the zodiac where the plane of the Moon’s orbit crosses the plane of the ecliptic. As with the Ascendant-Descendant, Midheaven-I.C., and Vertex-Anti vertex, the nodes are two ends of an axis 180° apart. The North Node (also called</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">94</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark119">the Dragon’s Head or Caput Draconis) is the point at which the Moon crosses the ecliptic heading north, and the South Node (the Dragon’s Tail or Cauda Draconis), the point where the Moon crosses the ecliptic going south. The nodes of the Moon have been obvious to astronomers since the beginning, because when the Sun is near them in its apparent orbit around the Earth, the new and full Moons tend to be eclipses. This is where the colorful terms Dragon’s Head and Dragon’s Tail come from: in mythology the nodes were believed to be inhabited by a dragon that swallowed the Sun or Moon whenever these bodies came too near. We now know, as did the ancient astronomers, that the nodes are simply places where the Moon and Earth become aligned with the Sun so that the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth (solar eclipse) or the Earth casts a shadow on the Moon (lunar eclipse). The lunar nodes move backward in the zodiac at the rate of a little over 3’ of arc per day, completing one turn around the zodiac every 18.6</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The lunar nodes are not new in astrology, but they seem to have come into general use in the West only in modem times. In India they have been widely used much longer. What they indicate is a matter of controversy. In Hindu astrology both nodes are considered malefic, but in the West the North Node is considered easier and the South Node more difficult. Some compare the North Node to Jupiter and the south node to Saturn. My own work suggests there is some truth in this. But clear distinctions can be made between the two nodes only when bodies are conjunct one of them. Otherwise, any body that aspects one aspects the other equally.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some writers consider the nodes to indicate past incarnations. This may be true, but it is difficult to prove. Karmic astrology is too often the refuge of those who cannot bear to have their ideas tested in practice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One widely held idea that I agree with is that the nodes relate to connections with other people: that is, they are an axis of relationship. In this context, the North Node has a joining quality, while the South has a separating quality. Since these are nodes of the Moon, it is likely that they have to do at least somewhat with connections involving the feelings. And since they come from the intersection of the orbital plane of the Moon and the plane of the Sun’s apparent orbit around the Earth, they plausibly have something of the quality of the Sun/Moon midpoint. I have noticed that when the nodes are heightened in the chart there is a greater tendency to go and meet people. I also find that when two people have important connections between major factors in one chart with the North Node in another, the relationship is more constructive than if the connection is with the South</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">95</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Node. I have not been able to validate other ideas about what the nodes mean. The fact that astrologers disagree about them suggests that the nodes are less powerful than factors about which there is more unanimity. But I do not at this time advocate ignoring the nodes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark120">Until recently, astrologers used the mean lunar nodes, which travel backward in the zodiac at a uniform rate. Then in 1975 Digicomp Research Corporation published an ephemeris entitled </a><i>True Lunar Nodes 1850-2000</i>. This was based on the fact that while the Moon’s orbital plane gradually revolves backward in the zodiac, it also wobbles so that the actual lines of intersection move back and forth over the short run. Consequently, there is disagreement about how to locate the nodes because the mean position differs from the wobbling position by up to 1°45’ at any give time. The <i>American Ephemeris </i>gives positions of both the mean and wobbling nodes. The wobbling nodes are no more “true” than the mean nodes, as they are in their own way just as abstract a concept. They should not be used until research has indicated which, if either, of the two sets of nodes is more valid. The final word has yet to be said, but at this time I am more inclined to use the conventional mean nodes.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planetary Nodes <span class="p">As the orbital plane of the Moon intersects the orbital plane of the Earth (or apparent orbital plane of the Sun around the Earth), so do the orbital planes of the planets intersect the Earth’s orbital plane, giving rise to the planetary nodes. Viewed heliocentrically (from the viewpoint of the Sun), the nodes of each planet are exactly opposite each other in the zodiac, but shifting to the geocentric (Earth-centered) frame of reference more common in astrology causes them to appear to be not in opposition (there is, however, very little shift with the outer planets).</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the face of it, if the Moon has nodes, why not the planets? Unfortunately, because of the difference between the heliocentric and geocentric frames of reference, there are problems with the definition of the planetary nodes, and consequently, where they are located. All the other nodal points discussed here have axes that pass through the Earth. With these, the axis passes through the Sun.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>The Node Book </i>Zipporah Dobyns has written the most extensive work on the planetary nodes and has included an ephemeris of their geocentric positions. There are also computer chart casting services that calculate these positions according to Dobyns’s method. In his book <i>Astrology of Inner Space</i>, however, Carl Payne Tobey gives a convincing argument for using the heliocentric node positions in a geocentric chart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But even if we decide which node positions to use, there is still a problem. According to Dr. Dobyns, the nodes of the planets have a symbolic</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">96</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">meaning similar to those of the planets to which they are connected. This in effect gives every planet three longitudes in the chart: its actual geocentric longitude and the longitudes of the two nodes. This greatly increases the probability of chance results. To make the nodes useful, we have to come up with criteria that clearly distinguish between the nodes and their respective planets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Again, I do not suggest ignoring planetary nodes, but using them might best be put off by beginners.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Aries Point <a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="s31">The first point of Aries, 0° Aries, the vernal point, or the vernal equinoctial point is, as defined in </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">2</span><span class="p">, where the Sun is at the astronomical beginning of spring, about March 21. It, too, is a form of node: the north node of the ecliptic with respect to the equator. Where the Sun crosses the equatorial plane going north is 0° Aries; the south node is 0° Libra.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31" name="bookmark121">As the beginning of the tropical zodiac, 0° Aries has been used since the ancient Greeks and the dawn of modern horoscopic astrology. Whereas in most astrological systems it has been treated only as the beginning of the sign Aries, however, it was given a new role in the 1920s and 1930s in the Uranian system of Alfred Witte and his followers. According to Uranian usage, 0° Aries represents 0° of all the other cardinal signs (Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn) as well. The reasons for this will become clear in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter 8</a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">.</a></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">I have found the Aries point extremely useful. Although it is not an energy source like a true planet, the Aries point is treated like a planet in that it receives and gives aspects in the normal manner. Most important, it can be the focus of midpoint combinations (see </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter </a>8<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">According to the Uranian school, the Aries Point, Moon’s nodes, and Ascendant represent a hierarchy of relationships. Whereas the Uranians say that the Ascendant-Descendant axis relates to general social interactions, and the lunar nodes to more intimate kinds of meetings, my own experience indicates that the Ascendant-Descendant axis signifies the more intimate contacts. I do agree, however, that the lunar nodes often signify relationships that come about because the individuals feel they have something in common, a feeling that has its roots in lunar symbolism.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Of the three nodal points of relationship, the Aries Point represents the most impersonal but also the widest social contacts: one’s relationship to the larger world around one. Hence it is associated with fame and greater social significance. If one ever becomes famous or makes a significant impact on society outside one’s circle of friends and associates, it is through symbols that relate to the Aries Point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">97</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, a large number of aspects and/or planetary pictures or midpoint combinations to the Aries Point does not in itself ensure fame. The Aries Point and the points connected to it only tell what energies are available to one by which to make an impact should one ever wish to try. Involvements concerning the Midheaven and the tenth house are much more likely than an active Aries Point to indicate that a person will try to become famous. The reason is that an active Midheaven signifies people who have a strong ideal of significance that they must attain. In this respect, the Midheaven is strongly connected to the father complex of symbols, which includes the Sun, Saturn, Capricorn, the tenth house, and, to some extent, Jupiter. Not only should the Aries Point itself be checked, but also its midpoints with the personal points: the Midheaven, Ascendant, Sun, and Moon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part32.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part34.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
