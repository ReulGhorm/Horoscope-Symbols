That is, from the viewpoint of Earth it appeared to be traveling backward in the zodiac. Periodically every planet except the Sun and the Moon appears to do this.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The literature on retrograde planets is conflicting. Ideas range from the belief that they are cursed, totally incapable of turning out well for an individual, to the belief that they have no effect at all. Some astrologers feel that retrogradation inverts or diverts a planetary energy so it is not expressed as directly and forthrightly as it might otherwise be. Others feel retrogradation makes a planet act more slowly. Still others think it causes a planet to operate more on the subjective level. (My only problem with this is that I believe horoscope symbolism always operates on a subjective level first, and only afterward is it projected onto what others would call an objective level of reality.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fact that astrologers have been unable to agree on retrogradation used to make me suspect that retrogradation is insignificant. But I have since changed my views. What follows is an examination of others’ ideas about retrogradation, along with my own theory about what it means.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">First, it is clear that in a natal chart, at least, retrogradation does not destroy a planet’s influence or make it incapable of doing good. This extreme view derives from horary and electional astrology, special procedures for answering specific questions and picking favorable times for action. In horary and electional charts, if the planet symbolizing the activity that is of main concern is retrograde, it is supposed to signify that the matter can come to no good. This may be true in these branches of astrology, but not necessarily because retrogradation hopelessly blights the planet. I</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">believe that retrogradation does not signify any kind of intrinsic disability for a planet, except insofar as anything that affects a planet will make it better suited to some situations than to others. No astrological energy is well-suited to every occasion. Further on, I will show why I think retrogradation might adversely affect the significator planet in a horary or electional chart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I also reject the idea that retrogradation weakens a planetary energy or makes it less capable of manifesting. Astrologers who believe that it does forget that the outer planets are retrograde a large proportion of the time. For example, almost half the population has Pluto retrograde. And when the Sun and Jupiter are in trine, a very positive aspect according to most astrologers, Jupiter is usually retrograde.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I can, however, accept the possibility that retrogradation alters or diverts the energy of a planet from its normal paths. And I find it reasonable that a retrograde planet does not as often manifest on an external plane. To see why, it is necessary to examine what retrogradation is in astronomical terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 600pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="319" height="800" alt="image" src="Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark76">Figure 2. Direct and retrograde motion of the inner planets</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: left;">When a planet is retrograde, it is actually closer to the Earth than when direct. This is easy to see with Mercury and Venus, whose orbits lie</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="s31">between the Sun and the Earth’s orbit. In </a><a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="a">Figure </a>2A<a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="s31">, Venus is on the far side of the Sun. From the Earth’s viewpoint, Venus here appears to be traveling forward in the zodiac, just as the Sun always appears to. Venus appears to be in Aries at instant 1, in Taurus at instant 2 and in Gemini at instant 3. In </a><a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="a">Figure </a>2B<a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="s31">, however, Venus is between the Earth and the Sun. As you can see, Venus is traveling forward in its orbit the way it always does, but from the viewpoint of Earth it looks as if it is going backward against the background of the fixed stars. In </a><a href="part20.htm#bookmark76" class="a">Figure </a>2B<span style=" color: #000;">, Venus appears to be in late Taurus at instant 1, in middle Taurus at instant 2 and in early Taurus at instant 3. It will appear to turn direct when it starts to go around behind the Sun.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part20.htm#bookmark77" class="s31">Retrogradation is also easy to see with the rest of the planets, from Mars on out to Pluto. Because these planets are all farther from the Sun than the Earth is, they move more slowly in their orbits than does the Earth. When the Earth overtakes them, it is like a faster-moving car overtaking a slower-moving car on a highway. Seen from the faster-moving car, the slower-moving car appears to be going backward, even though it is only going forward more slowly. In </a><a href="part20.htm#bookmark77" class="a">Figure </a>3A<a href="part20.htm#bookmark77" class="s31">, the Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the Sun. As seen from Earth, Mars appears to be going forward in the zodiac, from Aries at instant 1, to Taurus at instant 2, and Gemini at instant 3. In </a><a href="part20.htm#bookmark77" class="a">Figure </a>3B<span style=" color: #000;">, the Earth is overtaking and about to pass Mars, and so from Earth’s viewpoint Mars appears to be going backward in relation to the background of the fixed stars from late Taurus at instant 1, to middle Taurus at instant 2 and early Taurus at instant 3. Note that Mars and the Earth are on the same side of the Sun and hence closer to each other than they would otherwise be.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fact that planets are closer to the Earth when they are retrograde makes it seem absurd to say that retrograde planets are weaker. If there is any connection at all between distance and strength in astrology, you would expect retrograde planets to be stronger.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">My observations suggest, however, that a retrograde planet is not so much stronger as it is closer to a person’s center. I feel that its closeness to Earth symbolizes the person’s lack of distance or lack of perspective in dealing with what that planet stands for. Someone with a retrograde planet is less able to be objective about that planet’s energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This has its strong and its weak points. The advantage is that one sees the planet’s energies at close range, and is deeply, intensely, and intimately involved in them. But when one is too close to something, it is hard to gain perspective. One tends to take the relatively unimportant seriously and to overlook what is truly significant in the long run. Being</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">deeply involved in something, one runs the risk of losing perspective, but to get an accurate perspective one must sacrifice close-range, intimate experience. Clearly, a balance is necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 594pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="410" height="800" alt="image" src="Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark77">Figure 3. Direct and retrograde motion of the outer planets</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark78">I am not suggesting an introversion-extraversion split. I believe that direct and retrograde planetary energies are each capable of being experienced as either external or internal. But I do suspect that retrograde energies are harder to experience as separate from oneself. If they are experienced as separate, they represent issues so close to one’s daily involvements that one is not easily able to stand back and get a clear view of how they operate. By contrast, it is easier both to objectify and to detach oneself from the energies of planets in direct motion, and thereby one is better able to take control of them.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is this feature that makes retrogradation such a bad thing in horary and electional astrology. Retrograde significators of the issue in question suggest that the individual is not detached enough from the matter to manipulate it with any skill. If one is too involved, one tends to act as the result rather than the cause of the energies that are around one. Unable to see clearly, one tends to act ineffectively.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When reading a natal chart, the astrologer can help the client to gain a perspective on any retrograde planets by exploring what they mean from a detached, objective viewpoint. In this way, the person with a retrograde planet can combine the intimate knowledge based on experience with the wisdom that comes from seeing with a sense of proportion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The foregoing is just a hypothesis that helps to account for my experience of retrograde planets. Keep this in mind when you apply these principles, and always remember that much more work needs to be done concerning retrograde planets and their effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The next chapter takes up the individual planets in detail. Though the categories outlined in the present chapter are useful for understanding the interrelation of the planets, there will necessarily be facets of each planet that do not completely conform to these patterns. Rather than making all the planets fit in, you should concentrate on getting the feel of each planet in its own right. When you fully comprehend the nature of each planet, the basis of the schema will become clear wherever it is presently obscure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part19.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part21.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
