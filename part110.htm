For example, the fourth house relates to one’s most personal life, family, home, and real estate. Many consider it also to relate to one’s unconscious mind. Some of these meanings deal with the individual psyche, some with interpersonal relationships, and some with conditions in the environment. Looking at these, one gets the impression that the houses are grab-bags of different meanings assigned by no regular system. This is one reason why the more radical astrologers have chosen to disregard houses altogether.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Yet there is a concept that will assist us in finding underlying order in house meanings. This, the concept of the relativity of house meanings, will be discussed below.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Moving Boundary of Polarity <a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">In </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">12</span><span class="p">, I mentioned that houses below the horizon tend to indicate the more personal parts of life and</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">those above the horizon the less personal parts. And yet we cannot make this the basis of a typology, certainly not an introverted-extraverted typology, because actual people with emphasis above or below the horizon fail to fit the descriptions one would expect.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As we move through the house descriptions in the next chapter, we will see that houses both below and above the horizon may refer to inward experiences, personal experiences, relationships, and even entities completely external to the self. Yet at the same time, with respect to any particular matter that has an inward-outward polarity, if we take any pair of opposite houses, one below and the other above the horizon, we find that the lower house relates to issues that are more inward and personal. For example, using traditional fortunetelling meanings, the second house relates to one’s personal finances, while the eighth relates to finances held by others or by the individual in connection with others. Similarly, the third house relates to one’s immediate environment, while the ninth relates to environments far removed from ordinary experience. On a more internal level, the third house represents the day-to-day semiconscious functioning of the mind, while the ninth describes the mind’s more conscious functioning. This shows us that each house can relate to both external and internal matters, but that the lower house always relates to the more inward end of any given polarity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark453">It seems, then, that the horizon does not act as a fixed boundary between two spheres of action and experience. Sometimes the line between personal and social should be drawn at one point, sometimes at another. The horizon represents the boundary between the two ends of the inner-outer polarity on any level. What determines the point of division between two issues is not an absolutely fixed criterion that separates inner from outer, but rather a moving criterion that is determined by the relationship of the poles to each other. Taking the third and ninth houses again, the third may signify one’s daydreaming and internal musings, while the ninth signifies looking out toward the external world. Or the third may signify looking out at one’s immediate world, while the ninth signifies looking at the world further removed from one’s experience. Similar cases can be shown for the other pairs of opposite houses. Houses can work at several levels, and the horizon is the dividing line for whatever level is operative.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Three Levels <span class="p">Any division of the levels at which houses operate must be somewhat arbitrary, but for clarifying the idea of levels, I have found it convenient to use a threefold scheme. The most fundamental level operates purely within the individual; I call it the internal level. The middle level covers self-other interactions; I call it the relational level. The</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">278</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">outermost level covers things that seem to be completely outside the self; I call this the external level.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>internal</i>, intrapersonal, or intrapsychic level of manifestation is the primary level at which all house energies operate. That is, all horoscope energies actually operate by creating effects within the self that in turn may be reflected at the other two levels. Expanding one’s awareness means becoming conscious of the internal origin of the other levels. By knowing who and what one is on this level, one understands one’s relationships and environment at the source and is better able to control them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the internal level, the horizon signifies the boundary between that which is more unconscious and hard to understand, and that which is more often and more easily made conscious. Energies that are nearest the I.C. are the most unconscious, and those nearest the M.C., the most conscious. But as the horizon is a moving boundary, there will be times when all the houses, even on the internal level, operate consciously, and times when all, especially the twelfth house, operate unconsciously.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What house energies do at the internal level establishes the basic style of their manifestation at all levels. Manifestations on the other two levels are a projection, literally a “throwing out,” of the energies within the self. This includes even environmental circumstances over which one apparently has no control.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the <i>relational</i>, interpersonal, or self-other level, one is aware of dealing with either an external circumstance or another individual. There is a sense of energies playing back and forth between the self and the other, such that one is aware of one’s own involvement in acting upon and experiencing the circumstances or the other individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark454">At this level the horizon signifies the boundary between that which is more personal and that which is more associated with the other. Energies that are nearest the I.C. are the most personal, and those nearest the M.C., the least personal. But here again the horizon is not a fixed boundary, so that the location of each house in the self-other continuum is relative, not fixed. Any house can pertain primarily to one’s own point of view in a self-other interaction, and any house can symbolize primarily the experience of the other. Traditionally, only houses three, five, seven, and eleven have been regarded as houses of relationship.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">At the external, societal, or environmental level, houses are also statements about relationships, but in the broadest sense of the term. One cannot be aware of something without being in some relation to it. Yet at this level one is not so aware of one’s own position in the relationship. This is the level at which entities in the external world appear to have an objective</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">279</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">reality, a reality apart from one’s relationship to them. This is the level at which houses symbolize specific things, like money in the second house, friends in the eleventh, or one’s spouse in the seventh. This is also the level of house manifestation at which astrologers become the most confused about the realities of astrology. They seduce themselves into thinking that the energies of the house describe objective realities about the circumstances or people surrounding the individual whose chart is being examined. But actually a house only states the individual’s relationship to the issues represented by that house. This is the level at which astrology most often becomes fortunetelling.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The external level is the one most removed from the source of the energy patterns, one’s inner self. Here the basic energies are the most disguised and hard to discern. Consequently, trying to manipulate the externals of one’s life without getting at their psychic underpinnings is usually unsuccessful. Changing the circumstances of one’s life without changing oneself merely brings the old circumstances back in new forms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">At the external level, the energies nearest the I.C. symbolize those outward circumstances that are most closely related to oneself. Those nearest the M.C. symbolize those circumstances and persons that are either farthest away from oneself or are related to one’s least intimate social roles. Again, the exact relationship of the houses to each other is not fixed but relative.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Importance of the Levels <span class="p">All houses operate on all three levels at once. It is only our changing awareness that makes it appear that a house energy is operating at any one level alone. The importance of this idea is that it forces us to look for the inner dimension of all events in life. In doing this, we can become aware of how an energy operates in our life, what it does for us, what it does to us, and why it acts as it does. Then, in turn, we can take responsibility for our lives, which is the first step in taking control of them.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traditional astrology was implicitly fatalistic in that it treated the horoscope as a description of factors beyond our control influencing, if not totally determining, our lives. Thus the houses, even to this day the most fortunetelling-oriented part of astrology, have mostly projected meanings, meanings that do not relate to the total consciousness of the events in question. But, as we have shown, every facet of the chart comes from the inward structure of the psyche. Astrology has not paid enough attention to this, and that is why houses have always had a missing dimension. For this reason, in the next chapter the internal delineations of the houses will in many cases appear strange and new. But with a little reflection you will see</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that the operation of the energies on this level easily gives rise to the more familiar manifestations I have characterized as either relational or external.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part109.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part111.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
