Primitive (being first), crude (raw, undirected energy), willful in an unstable, changeable way. Can be asocial or antisocial; wants freedom from others’ demands; not dependent upon social approval, hence pioneering; but also not concerned with being reasonable, prudent, timely, practical, or even effective, hence abstract in a self-centered way. Emotions are primarily enthusiasm, assertiveness, and short-lived anger; often impatient, and lacking in persistence and stamina, but a high energy level may compensate. Inherently frank. A vitalizing influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Taurus</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A vessel or matrix which manifests the energies of Aries in tangible form; a fecund creativity, developing energies which it receives and shapes, and imposing its own style. Stable, constant, persistent, limiting and contractive; earthy and sensual; not particularly social. A slow, deliberative influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Gemini</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Rapid mental exploration, understanding quickly but without empathy, learning quickly but without deep understanding, curious about the environment but not evaluating it in personal terms; sociable, but resists deeper attachments as confining; adaptable, not confrontative, but also inconsistent and inconstant. Fond of games and trickery. A quickening influence that raises planetary energies to a higher, more abstract level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Cancer</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Feeling part of something; emotional relationships, particularly to the past, childhood, family, mother, community, or homeland. A need for emotional security, an emotionally supportive environment, and nurturing personal relationships; if satisfied, this need is transferred to others so that Cancer, in giving these benefits to others, contributes in vital ways to social cohesion; but if this emotional need is not satisfied, the person may become fearful, grasping and possessive in an infantile way, smothering rather than nurturing others, substituting material possessions for the missing emotional support. An emotional, protective, nurturing influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Leo</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Developed ego and self-confidence, with a strong need for self- expression, for the admiration of others, and for uncompromising personal integrity, arising from fascination with self and a desire that others be similarly fascinated. A need for personal recognition, to be impressive, to control one’s destiny, to be a person of genuine significance, with honor. Image is the king or the Sun, source of energy and inspiration to others. May be arrogant if these basic needs are not met. Persistent and stubborn. A stabilizing influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Virgo</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The completed ego coming to terms simultaneously with the physical and the social universes as obstacles to which one must adapt, as frameworks for learning to be effective, and as realities that must be served. Submissive, efficient, effective; needs recognition for the quality of its workmanship; conforming, somewhat cautious and perhaps fearful, as if chastened for the excesses of Leo. Honest and realistic, seeks perfection or at least success in effecting changes through self-criticism and self-analysis. Bothered by the unreliability of the physical world; attempts to achieve control by concentrating on details, letting nothing escape its notice. High esthetic standards, but does not appreciate beauty without function; the sign of crafts. An influence of precision and care.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Libra</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first and most simple social relationship, the one-to-one dyad; intimate confrontation. Deft in dealing with others, takes the initiative while appearing to give in. Cannot conceive of self in a vacuum, but only in connection with another; needs intimate relationships for self-understanding and self-realization. Loves beauty and harmony and needs art, but may not appreciate or tolerate strong emotional content in art. A lighter and less serious influence, and a socializing influence through relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Scorpio</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ego death and transformation through emotional merger of egos. Mystical, seeing the power of transformation at work in ordinary reality. Transcendent elements of sexuality. Profoundly relativistic, seeing no difference between good and evil, embracing death experiences for the sake of the resurrection that follows. Fond of living intensely; dramatic, loves emotion, loves mystery. Usually not prepossessing or dramatic in appearance, but enjoys confrontation and fighting. Often misunderstood because perceptions and feelings are difficult to analyze and communicate; may blame self for this and compensate by secretiveness. An emotionally intense influence for transformation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sagittarius</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Learning to understand one’s social context and to express ones will in it, in terms of abstract principles and general patterns rather than details of implementation. The first type is idealistic and freedom-loving, desiring self-expression and social reform. Reluctant to be tied down in relationships or tradition. The second type is successfully integrated into the social order and desires to be socially useful and to act as spokesman for social cohesion; attracted to science, philosophy, religion, or other disciplines by which to study and discover the interrelatedness of all things; prefers wisdom to mere knowledge; more consistent and more willing to grapple with details of implementation than the first type. An influence for increased freedom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Capricorn</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Strong social orientation: most at home with social consensus about what is real, important and acceptable. Strongly influenced by authority figures. Needs to be in control, and effective in practical terms. As a representative of the social order, concerned with detailed, practical implementation of the consensus reality, rather than the abstract principles themselves. Over-serious, justifies play and rationalizes enjoyment by its social contributions; wry, self-deprecating humor. An influence for achievement in conformity with consensus reality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Aquarius</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Completes the socialization of the various aspects of self built up through preceding signs. The individual as a cooperative member of the group; gregarious, enjoys social interactions, values friendships, respects collective effort; needs social interaction to define self, but then tends to dominate the group; derives sense of ego from identification with group or social needs. Freedom-loving, in the sense of freedom to change society to fit its fixed ideals and ideas of perfection. More at home with friendship than with love. A social, mentally active, but emotionally dry influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Pisces</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the advanced type: transcendence of ego, subordination to the universe and to that which it embodies, surrender of the soul to God. In the primitive type: the embryonic stage prior to a new beginning. Ego and reality system not clearly defined, hence highly imaginative, and less self- assertive as something particular. Extremely receptive to influence from others: a passive victim unwilling to take responsibility (primitive type), or a seeker for truth at a deep spiritual level, possibly a martyr for truth (advanced type). May perceive alternate realities; primitive type will be confused by these. Apt to take refuge in an aloof, private inner world, which may be mere fantasy in the primitive type. Often drawn to social service; primitive types may maintain covert egotism by ensuring that their wards remain dependent. An influence that reduces forcefulness but enhances receptivity and empathy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part130.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part132.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
