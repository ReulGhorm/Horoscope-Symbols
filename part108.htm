My present choice is the Koch or Birthplace system of houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">At the outset, I did not use houses, but when I first started to investigate them, I used the Placidus system, simply because Placidus tables were the most available. Then, when for a time I followed the sidereal school of Cyril Fagan and Garth Allen, as an experimental alternative to Placidus I used the Campanus system, which is fashionable among siderealists. Campanus houses are neither tropical nor sidereal inherently, any more than are Placidus houses, but one tends to follow all of a school when one follows any part of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Later I was exposed to Edith Wangemann’s use of the Koch system. While I was not totally convinced of the validity of its geometry, in her hands it delivered results that I have seen in no other system. Also, and this was a decisive factor, it made something clear about my chart that was not clear from Placidus. Whereas in Placidus I have a sixth-house Sun, in Koch I have a Sun that is a mixture of the sixth and fifth houses. This tallies better</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with my experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Since adopting Koch, I have changed my use of house cusps. I now follow the ancient Greek idea that a cusp is the peak of a house’s energy, though not the beginning of the house. Such a cusp is not in the middle of a house, either; it seems to be 3° to 7° after the beginning, the actual number of degrees being dependent on the length of the previous house. The longer the previous house, the further into the next house the cusp is. Determining the actual beginning of the house is not important, however, because it is also apparent to me that the transition is not sudden, but gradual. Thus my Sun, which is about 4° back from the sixth-house cusp, is in the border area and is a mixture of fifth and sixth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark446">It is important to apply this principle consistently. I do not advocate moving the effective beginning of a house back a few degrees whenever you feel like it, or in order to save a precious theory. Such changing of the rules in midstream is the bane of astrological technique.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part107.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part109.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
