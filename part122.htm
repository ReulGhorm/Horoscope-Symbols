One’s hopes, wishes, and ambitions<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are two distinct themes in the traditional meanings of the eleventh house, and they are not obviously related. “Friends and social circle” can be understood in terms of the house’s being above the horizon in opposition to the fifth house. But the origin of “hopes, wishes, and ambitions” is obscure. Hopes, wishes, and ambitions (or, collectively, aspirations) are in an above-the-horizon house, but it is not immediately clear how they relate to social contact or what sense they make in terms of the eleventh being in opposition to the house of play. I suspect that part of the mystery results from using “aspirations” in too broad a sense. The eleventh house probably does not indicate aspirations in general, but rather a particular kind of aspiration that does fit in with its other core meaning. After looking at the other core meaning it may become plainer how aspirations have to do with social relationships.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eleventh house being in opposition to the fifth suggests that the two houses stand in some kind of polarity: that the eleventh house is in some way polarized to personal self-expression and play or activity pursued for its own sake. But we do not usually think of friends as opposed to play; in fact, they often go together.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The polarity exists in the idea of personal self-expression. The fifth house is almost completely self-centered. Even when it relates to love affairs, it relates to the personal enjoyment of love affairs and to one’s ability to be oneself with another. Like the fifth, the eleventh is a highly self- expressive house, but the expression is socialized; that is, it occurs in a social context, and the self-expression is modified by the demands of relating to others. The eleventh house does not usually demand that one repress one’s identity; rather, the identity is integrated with, and often expressed as part of, a group identity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As the seventh house symbolizes one-to-one relationships, the eleventh can be thought of as one-to-many relationships. This includes</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">friendships, for whereas people only have one mate, they usually have a number of friends. While the seventh house signifies an intense, face-to-face confrontation, the eleventh is more casual and oblique.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to friendships, the eleventh house signifies relationships such as membership in societies, organizations, and other social groupings. For example, one’s relationship to a corporation of which one is a member will be signified by the eleventh house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The thing to remember is that the eleventh house describes one’s ability to get along in any situation in which one has to relate to several people at once and in which one has to modify one’s behavior in order to get along. At the same time, the friends or group must in return support the individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eleventh house is above the horizon, indicating its social nature, and is also a succedent house, indicating it has something to do with resources. It is useful to think of it as a house of social attachments, in contrast to the second, which is a house of personal, often physical, attachments. As the second anchors one in the physical universe, the eleventh anchors one in the social universe. The idea of the eleventh as social attachments has roots in Hindu astrology, which uses basically the same house meanings as we do, but with some additions and deletions. The Hindu version of the eleventh signifies how one gets money. The second then becomes the house of what money one has rather than how it was gotten. Gaining money and resources is a direct function of one’s social integration, and social interaction is necessary to do it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Now let us turn back to the eleventh house as hopes, wishes, and ambitions, or, as we have summarized them, aspirations. First, I think that most interpretations of “ambition” do not properly belong to the eleventh house. As the need to be effective in general, ambition belongs to the first house, the house through which one makes an impact on one’s immediate environment. Professional ambition is usually signified by the tenth. Social ambition, or the desire to be someone important, also belongs to the tenth, traditionally the house of one’s social status and honor. Ambition probably should not be used at all as a keyword for the eleventh house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">“Hopes and wishes” implies ideals, and therefore this house is often called a house of ideals. I agree that there are ideals associated with the eleventh, but I do not call it primarily a house of ideals. I prefer to assign intellectual and philosophical ideals to the ninth house and moral and spiritual ideals to the twelfth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But ideals and aspirations are influenced by one’s group relationships, one’s social class, one’s friends, and one’s associates in any</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">field of activity. In fact, really to be part of a group means to share that group’s ideals and aspirations. At the very least it means having ideals and aspirations that are compatible with the group’s. One belongs to groups in order to work together for what all believe in. Thus the eleventh house becomes not a house of ideals and aspirations in general, but of shared ideals and aspirations, that are influenced and modified by the groups to which one belongs. This does not change the usual understanding of the eleventh house as much as one might think, because one’s ideals and aspirations are seldom held in a vacuum; they are usually conditioned by group relationships to a much greater extent than one realizes.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">On the inner level the eleventh house signifies one’s need to reach out and establish contacts with others and become integrated into a group. Although the eleventh is one of the most social houses, it still has an internal dimension, that is, a level of energy that exists within the individual prior to any external manifestation. This can be seen when some planetary energies in this house (Saturn, for instance) indicate a reluctance to connect with groups, and the reasons for this reluctance can be seen only in terms of inward, personal criteria.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Also at this level is the eleventh as shared ideals and aspirations. Such ideals may seem at least partly to originate in external experience, yet the eleventh, as an eastern house, is a house in which acting upon one’s world takes precedence over experiencing it. In other words, one has the ideals and aspirations to share with others before one finds the others with whom to share them. Then ideals may be modified by the resulting interaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Looking at the eleventh on the internal level as a house of group or social attachments, it can be seen as signifying one’s ability to identify with other people, and to make the identity of the group as a whole part of one’s personal identity. This relates the eleventh to the second house, which signifies one’s tendency to make objects in the outer world part of one’s identity.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">At the self-other level, the eleventh house signifies lighter relationships like friendships as well as relationships in which one is part of a group. Such relationships are most of the time more superficial than partnerships, but occasionally they can become close, one- to-one seventh-house confrontations, as when two friends sit down for a heart-to-heart talk.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">The eleventh house on the external level signifies the people and groups to whom we relate. As in all houses operating at the</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">320</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">external level, these people embody energies from within ourselves.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Eleventh House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the eleventh usually signifies people who act out and experience a large part of their lives in connection with friends or social groups. They are not usually rugged individualists, because they need group support to feel right about their position in life. But they will not usually be followers, either. They will be active parts of the groups, which they will support and which will in turn support them. They will also share most of their ideals and aspirations with the group. In connection with the common idea of the eleventh house as hopes and wishes, I have seen little evidence that people with strong eleventh houses are any more hopeful or wishful than average.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">By and large, the planets in the eleventh indicate the kind of friends one attracts, or the planetary energies one experiences in group contacts. Most planets do not greatly modify the effects of this house or inhibit the formation of group contacts, except for the following.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark483">Saturn in the eleventh may indicate loners who are reluctant to form friendships. Such people may feel that friends or social groups demand too much of their energy and deny them opportunities for self-expression. They find it easier to be alone, where they at least have the freedom to do what they wish. When they do find a friend or group that does not inhibit them too much, friendships or group relationships can last a long time. Alternatively, Saturn in the eleventh may simply indicate a preference for Saturnine friends.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus in the eleventh may also indicate difficulty in forming group contacts. The Uranian is often too independent to settle down and follow the ideals of any one group. But more commonly, Uranus in the eleventh indicates someone who forms contacts with Uranian groups or individuals.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If Pluto is in the eleventh and aspected so as to indicate the danger of power struggles, then it, too, can signify disruptions in one’s group contacts.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the Sun or Moon in the eleventh indicates a particularly strong need for group interaction or for having friends. All other things being equal, these individuals will only really thrive when they live in the context of shared ideals and aspirations, which support them in their pursuit of life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part121.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part123.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
