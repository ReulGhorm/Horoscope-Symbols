Effects may be obvious to others, but hard for the native to assess. A dynamic quality, patterns of action (events or changes) rather than passive states. Almost no coloring of its own, specific meaning derived from planetary compatibilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Two-Series or ‘Hard’ Aspects</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Events or changes at a definite point in time, with a clearly defined crisis demanding action, after which they pass away. Unstable energy patterns, they produce difficulty when the person or the environment resists the changes which they demand, but they are the only real means for creative change. Found prominent in the horoscopes of people who are very successful and talented, or very unsuccessful and unproductive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Opposition (180°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Analogous to the seventh house: polarity, strife, and conflict, but also partnership, cooperation, and consciousness. Conflicts develop when unrecognized parts of the self are projected; energy and growth in consciousness result when the projected parts are recognized and integrated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Square (90°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Energies working at cross-purposes, so that the achievement of one goal interferes with progress toward the other; a test of the validity of these goals. The mutual resistance of the two energies results in greater individuality; the resistance of material reality. The energies involved, and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the relationship between them, are usually difficult to perceive clearly. The instability of the square leads to ongoing growth to new levels except when, because of the person’s resistance, the conflict is repeated continually on the same level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Semisquare (45°) and Sesquiquadrate (135°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Similar to the square but not as intense. An unstable, dynamic linking of energies resulting in change. Incongruity and mutual resistance of two sets of goals challenges their validity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Three-Series or ‘Soft’ Aspects</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Less dynamic and usually less harsh than the ‘hard’ aspects. Stable energy patterns that resist change, but not static: homeostasis (‘dynamic equilibrium’) with no <i>net </i>change. Chronic changes or events that arise slowly and persist over long periods of time with no definite crisis; ongoing states of being.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Trine (120°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ease of action, without difficulty when one chooses to act within a status quo and in accord with the natures of the energies combined. Restores homeostasis (balance) after a condition of imbalance. Passive or receptive participation in events, with optimism and minimal expenditure of effort as in the martial arts (at best), or stuck in a rut (at worst).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sextile (60°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The symbolism of two times three: the sextile is to the trine as the opposition is to the conjunction. It often results in increased awareness, and usually represents circumstances which require some exertion of energy to reap the benefit, hence ‘opportunity.’ Preserves homeostasis (balance), but not to so limiting an extent as the trine.</p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Semisextile (30°) and Quincunx (150°)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The symbolism of three times four: the passiveness of the three- series combined with the tension and unease of the square. Relationships between entities with no logical connection, without enough energy to change the relationship, as e.g. the second, sixth, eighth, and twelfth houses are related to the first house. Routine annoyances and tensions of life; but also illnesses and death. Entities related by these aspects operate in conflicting ways, but each as if the other did not even exist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Five-Series—Quintile, Biquintile, Decile</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quality similar to that associated with Pluto, with overtones of Venus and Mars: some kind of concrete creation or destruction is effected. Intellectual functions (not excluding emotion) and all especially human matters. Transformational change. The ability to express creative inspiration (due to other factors) in concrete creations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Seven-Series—Septile, Biseptile, Triseptile, Semiseptile</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A Uranus-Neptune flavor, energy linkings not entirely of this world. Creative inspiration, but also mental and emotional difficulties and tenuous connectedness with the physical universe; religion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Nine-Series</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The novile or nonile. Completions, endings; what life produces in the long run; needs and capacities in relationships and marriage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part129.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part131.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
