And from a god-like perspective far above in outer space, the Sun is at the approximate spatial center of the solar system.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark71">From our subjective viewpoint, however, the Earth is the center. Human consciousness and ability to experience the solar system is centered here, not on the Sun. All the energy put out by the Sun and reflected in various ways by the planets is experienced by us on Earth. Experience by its very nature requires awareness, and the Earth is our center of awareness. If a tree falls in the forest, and there is no one to hear it, is there a sound? My answer is no: a sound is an experience, and if there is no one to do the experiencing, the experience does not exist. If there were sentient beings on another planet, their planet would be their subjective center. Subjectivity, unlike objectivity, can have a number of centers simultaneously.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The symbolism of the Sun and Earth is closely bound up with the symbolism of yang and yin. The Sun provides energy and heat, and the Earth provides matter that is animated by the Sun’s energy. Thus the solar system has a yang center and a yin center. The Sun is also one of the planets associated with the father, and the Earth with the mother.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The other planets derive their significance from their relation to these two centers. As we will shortly see, there is a special relation between the Earth and the Moon.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury and the Moon: The Two Modulators <span class="p">In physical terms, the body closest to the Sun is Mercury, and the body closest to the Earth is the Moon. And in symbolic terms, Mercury modulates the energies of the Sun, while the Moon does the same for the Earth. The concept of modulation is explained more fully in the next chapter’s section on Mercury, but in short, a modulator imposes a pattern on energy so that what started out as raw and undifferentiated becomes a meaningful arrangement. Modulation turns energy into information, as a radio turns electrical energy into speech or music.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mercury, the planet that rules speech, communication, and indeed all forms of transferring information from one medium to another, is the more obvious modulator. It is the first step in a stepping-down process from the raw energy of the Sun into the more particularized energies of the other planets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But in its way the Moon modulates also. You may wonder why I just discussed the Earth, because in the traditional horoscope the Earth has no place as a symbol. The Earth is implied by the presence of houses in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">40</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">horoscope, but it is not explicitly there as a symbol like the other planets. It is as if the Earth is too much a part of us for us to be aware of it. In astrology the Moon has taken on much of the Earth’s symbolism: its position as the primary yin force among all the celestial bodies, and its connection with nurture and the mother. The Moon modulates the symbolic energies of the Earth in that it takes energies that are a part of us and puts them out away from us so we can perceive them consciously.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark72">Thus Mercury gives the raw energy of the Sun an order that can be perceived, and the Moon makes the Earth’s reception of those energies into a form that can be perceived. Mercury modulates the Sun’s energy, and the Moon modulates the Earth’s experiencing of that energy. If Mercury’s modulation turns energy into information, then the Moon’s modulation produces a context without which the information cannot be received.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Mars and Venus: The I-Thou Dichotomy </b>Continuing out from the Sun past Mercury, we encounter Venus, and continuing out from the Earth past the Moon, we encounter Mars. Whereas the Earth-Moon system defined awareness and the Sun-Mercury system defined what there is to be aware of, Mars and Venus signify two kinds of <i>relationship </i>between the experiencer and the experienced.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mars relates by emphasizing the experiencer, the “I.” It defines the experiencer, gives the experiencer a definite form and shape, and makes sure there is a separate entity to do the experiencing. Venus emphasizes the relationship or the “thou.” It strives to create relationships among experiencers so that higher levels of being can arise out of the interaction of individuals. When Venus is working well, however, no one individual loses definition or becomes a less perfect expression of what it is.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A balance between Mars and Venus energies is necessary for continued relationships between subject and object. If either planet’s energy becomes excessive, relationship ceases. If Mars gets the upper hand, the entity tries to destroy the realm of the object, which the entity needs to give its own existence meaning. If Venus gets the upper hand, the entity loses the ability to survive as a separate experiencing entity.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter and Saturn: The Social Planets <span class="p">Jupiter and Saturn are so far away from both centers of the solar system that their positions viewed from the Earth are not that different from their positions viewed from the Sun. With this pair of planets, the distinction between subject and object, experiencer and experience is no longer so important. Whereas the bodies from the Sun out to Mars dealt with the individual’s personal existence and personal experience of the universe, Jupiter and Saturn introduce a larger</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">41</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">area of reality, that of the world in which one lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter is an archetype of support, and Saturn, of resistance. After you have achieved a certain degree of definition so you know who you are, you need to be integrated into a larger system. Whereas Venus integrates you into intimate relationships, Jupiter integrates you into the world. Jupiter represents an energy that causes you to grow and to leave the infantile matrix into which you were born. Jupiter signifies a kind of nurture related to, but different from, that of the Moon. Whereas the Moon supports an individual’s being, Jupiter supports an individual’s becoming, reaching out, and doing more and more with life. The individual is propelled toward and supported in becoming a member of the larger world, of the social order, the theater in which we work out our various characters in the drama of life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark73">With Saturn we encounter the rules of the drama: our obligations, what we must do to get others to play their roles with us on the same stage. It tests us, makes demands, and ultimately defines our reality for us, at least until we are ready to break free of the play. Rather than supporting us in our efforts to grow, it represents a resistance that we must overcome in order to take our place in the world.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Saturn is the outermost planet visible without a telescope. As such, it represents the limits of the reality that can be perceived by ordinary consciousness. After Saturn, something else must come into play, something that transcends ordinary reality and even sometimes destroys it so a new reality can be born.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto: The Transcendental Planets <span class="p">Just as they require a telescope to be seen, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto require an expanded consciousness to be dealt with constructively. All break the system of rules represented by Saturn. From the perspective of ordinary consciousness they are disruptive: Uranus brings unpleasant surprises, Neptune confuses us with what we perceive as false realities, and Pluto brings about disintegration and decay. But these are not the primary effects of these planets, they are only the result of our involvement with ordinary reality.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Viewed from an expanded perspective, these planets represent pathways out of the limitations of normal consciousness. Uranus releases us from the over-structuring of Saturn and grants us the opportunity for freedom. Neptune is a channel for other realities to come through to us, offering the possibility of truly new creations. All we need do is understand the role of Saturnine reality, give it no more than its due, and remain flexible despite Saturn’s tendency to harden us. Pluto brings the breakdown that precedes rebirth. Its sole demand is that one be willing to die so one can be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">42</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reborn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All three bodies symbolize the fact that even though the Sun is a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mighty star, there are billions more like it, and each bears the promise of other modes of being and consciousness. These other modes are available to us from the galaxy, and the transcendental planets are their channels. Just as Mercury modulates the Sun’s energy, giving it form, and the Moon modulates the manner in which we experience, so the outer three planets modulate what comes to us from beyond the solar system. Through them, we are potentially more than the children of the Sun and the students of Saturn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part18.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part20.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
