We pride ourselves on knowing today that matter is composed not of four, but of nearly a hundred elements.</a><a href="part85.htm#bookmark356" class="a">*</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Yet if the old doctrine of elements sounds silly, it is because modern people do not comprehend exactly what the ancients were saying. The ancients were not as concerned as we are with elements as chemical building-blocks, because they were not as occupied in establishing the objective reality of nature as distinct from human experience. Rather, reality and human experience were conceived of as one, a continuum. The same kind of symbolic analysis that today we might apply to understanding the human psyche was applied to nature as well. Thus the ancients were more interested in modalities of existence, in factors that pertain to characterisitics of the behavior of a thing, and (although they did not think of it this way) in the different modes in which people can experience the essence of a thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark322">If something was experienced as hot, sharp, active, and possessing a striking individuality of its own coupled with dynamism and a kind of inherent instability, it was conceived as having the nature of the element fire. If another entity was experienced as being solid, constant, material,</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">supportive and enduring, it was conceived as having the quality of the element earth. And so forth. If one were to ask a man of ancient times if he thought that someone with a fiery temperament actually had a greater amount of fire in him, the answer would be yes, but his conception of what it would mean to contain fire would be quite different from a modern person’s. The idea of substance has changed. In the Renaissance, people in the West began to acquire a more nearly modern notion of what substances are. Simply put, a modem person asking what elements something is composed of is not asking the same question as an ancient. Modern people ask what is the <i>objective reality </i>of a substance’s makeup, whereas the ancients asked what is its <i>subjective reality</i>, that is, what are the components of the <i>experience </i>one has of a substance. Fire or earth describe one’s experience of a substance, not its chemical nature. This way of thinking about the elements has survived unchanged in modem astrology. Thus, when we talk of a fiery temperament, we are talking of essential qualities of behavior and the way in which that behavior is experienced by others. No one in his right mind believes that a fiery personality actually contains more of the substance fire.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fire<span class="p">. Fire is the most positive or yang of all the elements. It is the energy of spirit, and operates within the universe by energizing and transforming. It is not characteristic of fire to work along lines already set, or to respond to energy patterns that are imposed from without. Fire is the principle by which all entities that are self-moving acquire that ability. It is active and dominant, not willing to allow circumstances to take the initiative. It signifies will. Whether experienced through an object or a person, fire’s operation within the universe is like a speedboat, which forces itself through the waves, not a sailboat, which moves through the water by taking advantage of externally supplied energies. Fire people tend to push their way through life rather than wait for times when external energies can provide them with the needed impetus.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fire in the modern sense is not an element at all, but a process of chemical change. Even as an ancient element it is inherently unstable. Whether human or otherwise, strongly fiery entities manifest the qualities of process, change, and evolution. Fire rises: it cannot stay at one level for long. This gives fire people a dramatic, intense quality. They do not enjoy standing still. Circumstances that force a fire person to endure a static situation usually cause depression and a sense of stagnation. Often such people will try to force events before they are ripe, which may result either in things becoming fouled up because of action that is premature, or in success being attained while others wait for a better moment</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Fire is an emotional element, but it tends toward the more active and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dynamic emotions—anger, joy, ebullience, and enthusiasm. It has a harder time dealing with sadness, depression, or the kind of feeling that comes from quiet contemplation of one’s surroundings. Fire people are usually very demonstrative of love and affection, although they do not always express these emotions in a sensitive way that takes into account another’s reactions. Fire people do not like to show sadness or grief: their typical response is to make fun of their own unhappiness. Even when they are down, they are often capable of making others feel better. But not being very sensitive to other’s feelings they run the danger of inadvertently hurting those who are more sensitive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark323">Being an outgoing, positive energy, fire does not easily play passive roles. It may be difficult for fire people to listen, perceive quietly, or reflect. There is often too much energy pouring out to leave room for another’s energy to come in. Fire connotes strength in a masculine way. Consequently fire people are apt to dislike weakness in others, especially if it reflects weakness in themselves. It must be said that the more conscious fire people do not demand more of others than they do of themselves, but they may still demand a great deal.</a></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth<span class="p">. The meaning of the symbolic element earth is clear from popular language. Earth signifies concern with the physical, with practical, common-sense matters. Wherever the metaphor of earthiness is involved, qualities of the element earth are implied. For example, an earthy sense of humor, which strips the world of pretension or of abstractions that obscure rather than elucidate, is a characteristic of many earth people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth is a symbol for direct sense experience of the physical universe, without ideas, concepts, beliefs, or wishful thinking to cloud perception. It symbolizes the quality of being substantial and material. It is both matter and the need to deal with matter. Matter resists us; it pushes back on us as we push on it. We cannot walk through walls or occupy the same space as another material entity at the same time. Thus matter, and through it the symbol earth, signifies limits to our freedom (in which regard the element earth is related to the planet Saturn). We cannot do whatever we wish or go wherever we want because we are constrained by our own materiality and the materiality of the world around us. No matter how bound up in fantasies, ideals, or abstractions we are, we must always deal with earth and its concerns. Earth is the ultimate arena in which the acts we perform become manifest. And in the way we usually deal with the world, nothing is real unless it impinges in some way on the physical universe.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth must not, however, be thought of as limiting and structuring only in a negative way. It is also a support and a source of nurture. We often</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">refer to the Earth Mother as the source of all life and being. There is a fertile aspect to earth, enabling entities to come into a form of being in which they can be perceived by all. Water is also a fertile element, but it is not so likely to manifest its fertility as something tangible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike fire, earth is stable, the most stable of all the elements. Also unlike fire, earth is passive: it needs to be acted on and formed by an external energy. For earth people to be really productive, there must be a positive, assertive energy provided by the planetary combinations in their charts. Otherwise, the earth type of personality remains passive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark324">Earth tends to resist change, and it can signify structures that break down under pressure because they lack the flexibility that allows adaptation. Earth often represents stubborn conservatism, in which an excessive concern for what is “real” at any moment blocks the ability for any new reality to come forth. In this way, earth can become a barrier to the very function it is supposed to assist, namely giving form and substance to what is newly created. It should be clear that fire and earth are partners, capable of acting in ways that are antagonistic but requiring each other in order to make any impact at all.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Where fire wishes to change things, earth will usually try to make the best of the status quo. Earth signifies making do with what is available. Earth people are adept at dealing with the details that must be attended to in everyday reality in order to make it work effectively. Fire may provide the motivation, but earth provides the substance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth is effective for actualization, for turning dreams into reality. Sometimes the compromises that must be made with reality are more than the dreamer would wish, but at its best earth will make only those compromises that make a thing possible. Of course there are also earth types who in their efforts to actualize something will completely destroy the ideal behind it. Sometimes a lack of vision or an excessive concern with the petty aspects of reality will obscure earth’s comprehension of the whole and cause it to act out of fear rather than concern with practical reality. More than any other type, earth people need a broadening education. With a broad perspective they can be very effective, whereas with a narrow one they can be very negative.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Being a relatively passive element, earth perceives better than fire. Earth people are usually close to their gut reactions to life. They are at their best when they can use their own experience and perceptions, when they do not have to rely on what others have told them. Then they have an uncanny ability to go right to the heart of the matter and perceive what to do. But because of a limited ability to handle abstractions, an earth type acting on</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">concepts based on someone else’s experience is unlikely to understand a situation well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth may be very aware of the outer world that can be experienced through the senses, but it is not so aware of emotional considerations, which are more abstract, less tangible, and also more personal. Inner experience is valued less highly by the earth temperament, because earth tends to focus its perceptions externally. Virgo and Capricorn especially are inclined to sacrifice emotional needs when these come into conflict with their view of reality. Sometimes a concern for practicality actually gets in the way of practical achievement. This can happen when one neglects the emotions of those with whom one is dealing even though the emotions are as much a part of the environment which must be handled as are its purely material aspects. From this source comes the “efficiency expert” whose concern with efficiency is so great that he creates an environment in which no one can work. If carried too far, concern for what is real in a narrow, material sense may become completely irrational.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Air<span class="p">. While not as unstable, assertive, or willful as fire, air is a positive, yang element which shares fire’s animated quality. In fact, the word animate is related to words meaning wind. The wind was a metaphor for the soul or spirit because, like them, it animates living matter causing other objects to move while it itself is invisible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The difference between the symbols fire and air can be seen in the difference in the behavior of actual fire and wind. Fire rises, whereas wind moves horizontally. Fire strives to go higher, away from ordinary reality toward an ideal or abstraction, whereas air moves about horizontally relating everything it encounters in the physical world to everything else. Because of its association with horizontal motion, air is connected with transport, preeminently of ideas, but also of objects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Like fire, air can become so involved in abstractions that it loses touch with physical reality and practical considerations. But unlike fire, air hovers just above the Earth’s surface, so that though it is fond of abstractions, the abstractions are closer to physical reality than those of fire. Air is associated with thinking and logic, and as such it is less personal than fire. Fire is usually connected with the vital, personal drive, or the will, and the abstractions are one’s personal abstractions. But air, which has a social, external conception of truth, is more inclined to abstractions that have little to do with the individual. In this way air is similar to earth: both are primarily concerned with a reality external to the self. Fire and water are more concerned with personal, inward kinds of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">truth.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Air people are as willing to reform and change the world as fire people are, but they do it less as a personal expression. Air always has a strongly social quality. All three air signs have to do with relating to others</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—Gemini to the immediate world through mind and speech, Libra through achieving perfect balance within a one-to-one relationship, and Aquarius through group consciousness and interaction. Air lacks fire’s ability to go off on its own to be itself. This may appear to contrast strongly with the popular image of Aquarius as a sign of revolution, but the fact is that insofar as Aquarius is related to revolution at all (see the section on Aquarius in the next chapter), it is related to revolutionary movements, not non-conforming individuals. Aquarian revolutionaries desire freedom to impose their ideals on society as a whole, whereas fire types simply want freedom to be themselves. Air signs are much more likely than fire signs to make accommodations to the social group, but they still need a great deal more freedom than earth signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark325">Although air is very social, it is sometimes unable to handle real intimacy well. This is because air operates extensively, rather than intensively, trying to cover as much ground as possible in order to gain a comprehension of the whole. A close, highly emotional relationship may cloud one’s perception and interfere with experiencing the whole. Also, getting deeply involved with one person on an intensive level interferes with the need to experience many people extensively. Libra is the only air sign in which the drive for close, personal relationships is strong, but even here there is a detached, non-intimate quality often obscured by the cleverness of the sign at being winning in social encounters.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If clear, objective vision is the great strength of air, then inability to comprehend extreme emotionalism and sensitivity is its weakness. This weakness is compounded when the typical air sign does not even see this as a problem. An air-sign personality needs to develop sensitivity to the internal, emotional aspects of other people to match its comprehension of the external, objective aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Not only is the air intellect detached and objective, it is facile and quick. The air-sign mind can deal with more data faster and more efficiently than any other elemental type. It is excellent for observing, planning, and organizing. It is also excellent for creative, original thinking. It is less bound up in the status quo than earth but more concerned with effectiveness in the real world than fire. Hence it can combine the best of these other elements and signify truly effective innovative thought. Thus all fields of study involving the development of new techniques, methods, and practices are air. Air is also related to highly abstract, technical fields of study which</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nevertheless have some bearing on the real world—studies like science and astrology. What can be more abstract than the study of non-material ideas like the astrological elements, planets, houses, and signs? And yet when we use these to understand real human beings, what can at the same time be more practical? This combination of abstractness and practicality is an essential quality of the element air.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Water<span class="p">. Of the four elements, water is in some ways the most difficult to understand. This is partly because in our yang civilization, which emphasizes the patriarchal and masculine, water represents an inferior, repressed function. Water is the most yin of the four elements, and the most bound up in the maternal, feminine archetype which is so poorly expressed in our culture. Whereas in other times and cultures water was understood and given an honored place in daily life, in the modern psyche water has been relegated to a very primitive, internal level. This makes it difficult to deal with as well as difficult to understand.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Also, even strongly watery people who comprehend this element from first-hand experience cannot readily communicate what they comprehend. It is not, as is so often stated, that water people are poor at communication or unwilling to communicate. It is just that what they have to communicate is extremely difficult to put into words. This is true of all three water signs, but especially of Scorpio. Communication is difficult because water represents non-linear, non-rational, non-discriminative modes of thought—the very antithesis of air. Like fire, water’s style is to grasp everything as a whole. Fire and water both represent non-rational functions, but fire has more to do with sudden, lightning-like comprehension, whereas water has a subtle, feeling-toned understanding that comes into being at no particular point, seeming rather to have existed always. Though it sees in terms of discrete factors less well then any other element, water is the best at feeling relationships and the ways every thing interacts with every other thing. Water may see and understand in a way that is hard for the other elements, especially air, to comprehend, but it sees very well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Often the best way for water to communicate is by means of art, especially poetry and music. Water has no monopoly on artistry, but water people who happen to be artistic are fortunate because they have an appropriate medium for communication.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another factor that sometimes places a barrier between water and other elements is that water experience is very personal. In this respect water is nearer to fire, and more distant from air and earth. Water people’s personal experience can be so vivid that external reality fades into insignificance beside it. This is the origin of the apparent tendency of water</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">people to withdraw into private fantasy worlds. Though the observations of water people are very personal, they should be taken seriously by others. Even the most personal experience has significance at some level for humankind.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whereas fire rises, air moves horizontally, and earth stands still, water tends to sink and to penetrate. It moves down until it surrounds the roots of all things. For this reason, water is a symbol of empathy. Empathy is the ability to feel what another feels as if one were that other person (as contrasted to sympathy, in which one merely feels a kindred feeling). Water people therefore have to live in a relatively clean psychic environment. If they are surrounded by disturbed people, water types will pick up the disturbance as if the energies originated within themselves. In this way, a water person can be made to feel physically and/or psychologically ill even when actually very well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark326">On the positive side, a water person understands feelings and emotions better than any other elemental type, and is capable of great emotional depth and compassion for others. Water is a symbol of nurture, protection, and aid. Cancer especially has a strong maternal streak, but this trait is visible in Scorpio and Pisces as well. Although water is in some ways primitive compared to the other elements, it does not represent a lower function, except, of course, for the historical accident that our culture tends to regard the water function as inferior. Men in particular have a problem with the water parts of their nature because watery qualities are so out of accord with masculinity as defined in this culture. As a race we know both consciously and unconsciously that our ancestors came from the sea, and we regard water as a symbol for the divine matrix out of which all nature has been born. Earth may be the substance of which everyday reality is constructed, but water is the substance of the primordial universe, which preexists the formation of solid matter. More than any other element water is associated with the soul—the eternal, unchanging background that exists forever, against which the drama of individual life is played.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As water is a symbol for the matrix out of which all life has come, so water people tend to maintain a stronger tie with the matrix than do others. This is the reason for the greater emphasis on emotionalism that we have discussed, as well as for the degree of psychic ability that many water people exemplify. But it is also responsible for other characteristics. Water people often have stronger ties with the past, a stronger involvement with familiar people, places, and situations. Water tends to be conservative like earth; but whereas earth’s conservativism comes from overinvolvement with the concerns of the material world, in the case of water it arises from a need</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">for the emotional security of the familiar. The more psychologically insecure a water type may be, the worse the problem. In a strong water person, we have already mentioned the protective, maternal streak; in a weak water person, there can be emotional grasping and possessiveness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The metaphor of water sinking has another bearing on the psychology of the water-sign type. Unless there is some kind of positive energy either from inside the person or from the environment, water types are prone to depression and moodiness. They do not try to hide it as fire and air might. Instead, they almost seem to revel in it, which can be distressing to those around them, but which may not be as serious as it looks. To a water person, depression or moodiness is preferable to emotional deadness, which indicates that the individual feels cut off in some way from the source of life. Water has a need to self-dramatize like fire; but unlike fire, water is willing to take other people’s emotions seriously as well. Though fire is fond of self-dramatization, it is often impatient when other people indulge in it; consistency is not one of human nature’s strong points.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Creative imagination is the positive side of what is sometimes merely fantasy. Being in touch with the primordial matrix gives the water type the ability to bring something out of that matrix into being. Although it requires some earth really to actualize something, true creativity also requires the ability to see a possible existence where there was no existence before. Water people can bring new insights into human nature and give us all the ability to understand ourselves better. When water types retreat into private fantasy, it is only creativity without the earth to actualize it, or insight without the air to communicate it.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Elemental Qualities of the Planets <span class="p">As with all descriptions of types in astrology, the ones just outlined are of relatively pure elemental types, which almost never occur in the real world. Not only do most people have signs of several elements prominent in their horoscopes, there is also a factor besides the signs that must be considered before one can attempt to characterize an actual person as to elemental type. That factor is the relative strengths of the planets.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark327">Though they represent energies which the signs only modify, planets have elemental qualities like the signs, but in more mixed form. If a planet of a certain elemental quality is strong in a chart (for example, near the horizon or meridian axis, or involved with the Sun or Moon or otherwise the focus of a complex of aspects or midpoints) this can completely alter the elemental characteristics of the chart as they would be derived from simply counting planets in the signs.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Authorities disagree on the precise amount and proportion of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">201</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">elements in the planetary symbols, but what follows is a reasonably close approximation of the consensus. I find it not always safe to assume that the elemental quality of a planet is exactly the same as the sign or signs that it is thought to rule (see below, pages 201-210, for a discussion of rulership).</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fire<span class="p">. The fiery planets include without question the Sun and Mars, though Mars may have a touch of earth in it as well. Many consider Uranus to have a somewhat fiery quality, and I agree, though I am more inclined to assign it mainly to air. Jupiter, a hard planet to characterize as to element, is a mixture of fire and water, with some earth overtones.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth<span class="p">. The most purely earthy planet is Saturn. Much of what has been said about earth—its concern for form, structure and solidity—could have come from a description of Saturn as well. But Saturn is not totally earth, because it lacks earth’s fertile quality. Perhaps Saturn could be described as sterile matter awaiting the approach of life-giving energies from water and fire. Venus has some earth, but it is mixed with water, air, and a little fire. The only safe thing to say about Venus is that the yin elements, earth and water, predominate over the yang elements, fire and air.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part86.htm#bookmark359" class="s31">Mercury is often described as having an earthy side, probably because it is traditionally said to rule the earth sign Virgo. But I find this spurious: Mercury is not earthy, and it should probably not be assigned to Virgo. For my reasons, see the section on Virgo in </a><a href="part86.htm#bookmark359" class="a">Chapter </a>11<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Air<span class="p">. Mercury is instead the only purely air planet. The symbolism of air and Mercury are completely intertwined. Both are mobile, changeable, and strongly associated with transportation, thought, planning, and consideration. Both are involved with establishing relationships—at least the superficial but necessary first stages.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus, as we have mentioned, is also strongly connected with air, though its sudden, sharp, unexpected mode of acting is more characteristic of fire. It is clearly a mixture.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Water<span class="p">. The Moon and Neptune are almost purely watery. Though Neptune is often more like a vapor than a liquid, it is still not at all like an air symbol. In their different ways, the Moon and Neptune connect one to the fundamental matrix of being. Both are bound up with the unconscious and the emotions, the main difference being that the Moon is not so otherworldly as Neptune. Either planet strongly placed in a chart can indicate a water personality.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark328">Because of Pluto’s rulership of Scorpio, many astrologers would call it watery; but other astrologers consider Pluto to rule the fire sign Aries. Though I do not agree with this assignment, I feel it reflects something real about Pluto. Pluto has qualities of both elements: a moody</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">emotionalism that suggests water, and a tendency to glorify strength and power that suggest fire. I would say it is about equally both.</p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark329">The Elements and Jung’s Psychological Types </a><a href="part85.htm#bookmark357" class="s31">Elements are a fourfold typology, and so are the four temperament types of the psychologist Carl G. Jung. It is thus tempting to try to connect Jung’s psychological types with the four elements. Jung believed they were related, but never specified exactly how, and as a result debate has raged among psychologically oriented astrologers as to which element goes with which psychological type. Those astrologers who accept the connection at all usually agree that earth equates to sensation and air to thinking.</a><span class="s24">* </span><span class="p">But they are more divided on how fire and water relate to feeling and intuition. Part of the problem is that it is hard to come to definitions of “feeling” and “intuition” on which everyone can agree. Such definitions must be the first step to understanding any relation to the elements. Therefore, before seeing whether a connection should be made between the elements and Jung’s types, let us look at how Jung actually defined his terms.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To Jung, <i>sensation </i>is used in the ordinary sense: it is the function that works through perceiving via the senses. It does not make judgments, it is simply concerned with what is so in the outside world according to the senses. Because sensation by itself does not attempt to organize or judge what it perceives, Jung calls it an irrational function.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>thinking </i>function is much as one might expect. It is a process of ordering and making sense out of what is perceived. It is therefore a rational function.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>feeling </i>function informs the observer as to whether something is good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It is a judging faculty, and since, according to his criteria, it has an ordering function like thinking, Jung considered feeling a rational function. It has little to do with the usual idea of feeling as emotion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>intuition </i>function gives one a sense of understanding via a nonrational, usually subconscious, means. One suddenly realizes what it is one has perceived. Like sensation, intuition does not judge or order its understanding, and it is therefore irrational.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark330">You can easily see the problems here. First, there is Jung’s unusual use of the terms “feeling” and “rational.” Jung departs from the popular use of “rational” as synonymous with “logical” or “reasonable,” but he uses the word correctly in one of its senses. His use of the word “feeling,” however, corresponds with none of the common meanings of the word. A tendency to judge the value or worth of a thing is different from a tendency to have an emotional reaction to what one encounters. The first is indeed rational, as</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jung says, whereas the second is not.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Then there is another problem. The way Jung conceives of the four types, feeling is a polar opposite to thinking, and sensation to intuition. That is, the two rational functions lie opposite each other, and the same goes for the two irrational functions. In Jung’s schema, one cannot be a thinking- and feeling-dominant person at the same time; neither can one be a sensation- and intuition-dominant person at once. A person has to be either a pure type or a mixture of adjacent types such as thinking-intuition, sensation-thinking, feeling-intuition, etc. In astrology, however, one can be any mixture of two or more elemental types. This should be an immediate tip-off that the two fourfold typologies cannot be equated in any simple way.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But there are more problems. First, whereas the four Jungian types are primarily concerned with perceiving, the four elemental types relate to ways of acting as well as to ways of perceiving. Second, the fit between each element and any possible corresponding psychological type varies from good to unconvincing. Let us look at each, and see what the difficulties are.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fire suggests to many the intuition function. This is because fire tends to perceive in pictures, and to get an instantaneous grasp of a situation. Fire does not reason or think in any classical sense of the word: it either understands or it doesn’t. This is why fire people can be extremely creative yet not good at logical reasoning. Both fire and intuition are nonrational in any sense of the word. But the kind of emotionally toned psychic perception that also fits Jung’s use of “intuition” is not so characteristic of fire. Psychic perceptions usually relate to some hidden aspect of truth in either an external or an internal reality. The intuitive grasp of fire more often relates to something that does not yet exist—an ideal, an original concept, or simply an intention of the individual to bring something that does not yet exist into being. The psychic aspect of Jung’s intuition function is more characteristic of water than fire.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">For these reasons, many have assigned fire to the feeling function instead. But fire people are no more prone to making good-bad judgments than any other elemental type. This is why I think none of the four elements have anything in common with Jung’s feeling type.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark331">Earth is usually equated with sensation. The correspondence is good here, but there are still problems. It is true that earth signs are most concerned with perceiving an external, physical reality. But earth is not simply concerned with </a><i>perceiving </i>it, it is also concerned with ordering it in the way that is most effective in a given situation. In Jung’s sense of the word, earth is extremely rational, whereas the sensation function is not.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo and especially Capricorn need to make judgments about good and bad, and Taurus is much concerned with pleasantness and unpleasantness. In terms of Jung’s definitions, earth is almost as concerned with feeling as with sensation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Air is usually given to thinking, and this is probably the least defective of the assignments. But here again we must realize that air connotes more than the rational analysis of perception. Like fire, air may be more concerned with things that are not yet real, that are abstract and unrelated to a given reality. Also, air connotes a restlessness of behavior, a will that goes out into the world to encounter it, rather than simply sitting back passively to make order of what it perceives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Water presents the greatest difficulty. It most certainly relates to what is meant by the popular conception of “feeling.” But even though water may feel good or bad much more quickly and sensitively than the other elements, it is no more judgmental as to whether something may be good, bad, pleasant, or unpleasant. And, unlike the feeling function, water is in no sense of the word rational, neither according to Jung’s nor anyone else’s interpretation of the word. As we mentioned in connection with fire, if intuition means nonrational, nonlinear perception, then water is at least as connected with intuition as fire is.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I suggest that in fact the four elements do relate to four cognitive modes as well as to other areas of life, but that these four cognitive modes are only somewhat like the four Jungian types. Here is a summary of the way I would associate cognitive modes with the four elements.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fire <span class="p">perceives through pictures and sudden flashes of insight. A fire person will study something for a long time without comprehending it, and then the significance will become clear in an instant. Fire tends to be involved with abstractions and, often in an effort to bring them into being, with matters that do not yet pertain to the real world, at least the world of consensus reality. In the way that fire perceives, there is always a strong mixture of will or desire and a need to transform. Fire is often psychic, in the ordinary meaning of the word.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Earth<span class="p">’s perception is less influenced by personal desire than fire’s. It is much more concerned with objective reality. It wants to know what is really so, and it defines its criteria according to what can be collectively perceived and experienced. Not especially concerned with abstractions, it may even be impatient with them. Instead, it is greatly concerned with perceiving order in the world and with making that order more effective and apparent. Like Jung’s sensation type and unlike fire, earth is quite rational in its functioning.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark332">Air </a><span class="p">is as concerned with the relationship of things in the outer world as earth is, but air is more interested in abstractions. It is less taken up with the order that may be inherent in observed matter, and more with the order that mind may impose on matter. Much more than earth, air will take simple sense data and build on it elaborate intellectual structures that will often lead away from the sense data. Air is quite rational in both Jung’s and the popular sense of the word.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Water <span class="p">gets information from emotionally toned perceptions that may not come via the senses. Whereas fire tends to think in pictures, water perceives by means of feelings. Water is feeling in the conventional rather than the Jungian sense of the word. Like fire, water perceives in a very personal way and it is concerned less with consensus reality than it is with personal experience. Water is even more psychic than fire, but it is far more difficult for water to translate its perceptions into words. Water is definitely irrational in every sense of the term.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What we have in this section is one example among many of astrologers attempting to make a one-for-one translation from one symbol system (Jungian psychology) to another (astrology). Often this is done in order to legitimize astrology, but this is unfortunate, because astrology understood as a system of psychology in its own right has a symbolic framework much more powerful than any in orthodox psychology. It would be unrealistic to expect that one man in one lifetime could develop an understanding of symbols as profound as that of astrology, which has been developing for thousands of years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part78.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part80.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
