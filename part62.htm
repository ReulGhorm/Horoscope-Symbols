This chapter gives brief delineations of all possible pairs formed by the ten planets, the lunar nodes, Ascendant, Midheaven, and 0° Aries Point. The factors that are not planets are included here because experience has shown that their midpoints are important and can be treated the same as midpoints involving only planets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The delineations in this chapter can be used in several ways. First, they are a short guide to how two factors in aspect will interact. Second, by scanning through them you will get an idea of what midpoint axes to look at to answer specific questions about the horoscope. Third, when you have a factor at the midpoint of two other factors, you can use this chapter to delineate a three-factor combination. For example, if you have Sun/Moon=Uranus, you can look up Sun/Moon, Sun/Uranus, and Moon/Uranus. These three delineations will give you an idea of what this three-planet combination means. You can also use this method for three- factor aspect patterns like the grand trine, T-square, minor grand trine, and yod, and can even extend it to combinations involving more than three factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This summary of meanings is based not only on putting together the keywords for each factor, but also on other indications that have been found by various researchers including myself—meanings that do not always follow obviously from the key ideas of the planets, at least not until one gets into them more deeply than usual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part63.htm">Pairs with the Sun</a><a class="toc0" href="part64.htm">Pairs with the Moon</a><a class="toc0" href="part65.htm">Pairs with Mercury</a><a class="toc0" href="part66.htm">Pairs with Venus</a><a class="toc0" href="part67.htm">Pairs with Mars</a><a class="toc0" href="part68.htm">Pairs with Jupiter</a><a class="toc0" href="part69.htm">Pairs with Saturn</a><a class="toc0" href="part70.htm">Pairs with Uranus</a><a class="toc0" href="part71.htm">Pairs with Neptune</a><a class="toc0" href="part72.htm">Pairs with Pluto</a><a class="toc0" href="part73.htm">Pairs with the Lunar Nodes</a><a class="toc0" href="part74.htm">Pairs with the Ascendant</a><a class="toc0" href="part75.htm">Pairs with the Midheaven</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part61.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part63.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
