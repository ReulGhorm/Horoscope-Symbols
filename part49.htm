The explanation is beyond the scope of this book; suffice it to say that midpoints work. I use midpoints because they often give information that would not otherwise be available in the chart. Without them, I have seen important characteristics of a person and events in a life completely overlooked.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In judging the “cosmic state” of a planet—that is, how well it can function more or less in keeping with its intrinsic nature—I look at not only the house and sign and what aspects the planet makes, but also at what midpoints the planet falls on and what midpoints it forms with other planets. If a planet is connected by midpoint to other symbols in the chart that are in tension with the planet’s fundamental nature, it will make the functioning of that planet’s energy ambiguous and difficult. Midpoints that are combined with a single planet in the chart become part of that planet’s total expression. Whatever transit, progression, or solar arc direction sets that planet off in later life sets off the midpoints attached to it as well. Therefore, an understanding of the midpoints attached to a planet can tell a great deal about how that planet will operate in a person’s life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Midpoints give information that is more particular than aspects, signs, and houses can give. This is because there are so many midpoints: the domain of what each symbol signifies is smaller. Each symbol is thus much more clearly defined and limited. Midpoints are like planets, but with a more concentrated focus.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The result is that we can give midpoint combinations detailed, quite specific delineations. One can then tell if the horoscope is “working”:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">whether it is really giving useful information, or whether the astrologer is simply trying to make the chart fit the client. The more precise the statement one makes from a chart, the better one learns the effectiveness of one’s techniques. It is partly unavoidable with human beings, but it is also partly out of sloppiness that conventional astrology often yields delineations that are so vague as to be worthless.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark240">Using midpoints, one can rely more on the chart itself and less on intuition. I have nothing against intuition; it can give useful information. But I think that astrologers, since they take the trouble to erect horoscopes, should be able to derive most of their data from the chart. Systematic technique can make an astrologer effective even on days when intuition is not forthcoming.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">And there is one extra benefit from midpoints. A midpoint analysis of a chart for which no birthtime is known can yield more and better data than the common technique of using a solar chart (in which one uses the Sun’s longitude as an Ascendant).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part48.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part50.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
