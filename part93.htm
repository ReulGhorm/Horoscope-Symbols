In the first half, the signs traced the formation of the individual from the first assertion of individuality in Aries to the complete individual in Leo, and concluded in Virgo with the first realization of an external necessity to which rampant individuality must be somewhat subject.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the second half of the zodiac the individual learns to relate to and integrate itself into the reality and social order beyond itself. This half of the cycle extends from Libra (signifying the first and simplest interpersonal relationship, the one-to-one intimate confrontation) to Pisces (in which the socially integrated individual encounters something beyond society and reality as normally conceived: the mystical oneness of the universe).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To some extent, each sign in the second half in some way parallels its opposite sign in the first half, carrying out on a social level what was begun in the opposite sign on a personal level. But we should not get carried away with this idea. Each of these signs also possesses an individuality of its own which in many cases does not seem to follow from its being the social counterpart of its opposite sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">So it is with Libra. Though it is the sign in which the individual first makes an accommodation to another individual in a one-to-one relationship, it is also a sign of aesthetic development, with a strong love of beauty and harmony. Also, it is not as immature with respect to the social integration of the individual as Aries is with respect to the formation of the individual. We have to remember that Aries is the first fire sign, whereas Libra is the second air sign. Thus Libra is farther along in the air cycle of development than Aries is in the fire cycle. Libra is deft in dealing with others, has a highly developed knowledge of the art of getting along, and can often get what it wants from another by apparently giving in. That Libra is the sign of the sweet and beautiful goddess Venus is often noted; that it is also a cardinal, positive sign is noted less often. Libra excels at taking the initiative in such a way that others do not realize the initiative has been taken.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being the sign of the simplest of all relationships, the one-to-one,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Libra has difficulty in thinking of other modes of relationship. It sees in terms of polarities: I versus you, this person versus that person, we versus they. And very often for “Versus” one may substitute “together with.” The key idea is that Libra cannot conceive of self in a vacuum. Self is developed only in connection with another self. Libra needs another with whom to have a dialogue. But Libra does not need to be subservient to another; in fact, it may well be dominant.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because Libra needs the juxtaposition of itself to another in order to develop self-understanding and self-realization, Libra people tend always to be involved in an intimate relationship. As soon as one ends, another begins. Libra persons may also be good at professions that involve one-to- one counseling such as the law, psychology, and any other field in which one acts as a consultant. However, these professions also require strong indications from other parts of the chart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Libra completes a process begun in Virgo. In Virgo, one becomes aware of external necessity and tries to accommodate oneself to it by serving it, being useful to it, and learning to function as efficiently as possible with respect to it. In Libra, the individual encounters the other as an equal. Interdependence is the key rather than one-way service; partnership rather than subservience.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark378">The most Venusian aspect of Libra is its concern with beauty and art. Libra does not necessarily indicate artistic ability, but Libra persons seem to need art more than others. Libra likes beauty, and it may not appreciate art that is stormy, intensely personal, dramatic, and emotional if those qualities of self-declaration take precedence over beauty. Libra may have a taste merely for the pretty if the individual has not learned to handle the emotional content of art. Libra is an air sign, and in all its encounters with the world, both in art and relationship, it has the usual air-sign difficulty in dealing with intense feeling.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Libra to Venus and the Asteroids <span class="p">We have already discussed the problems of relating Venus to Taurus. While I prefer Venus as the ruler of Libra rather than of Taurus, I must acknowledge at least one difficulty. Venus is clearly a negative, yin planet, while Libra is a positive, yang sign. In this respect, Venus would clearly seem to be more suited to negative, yin Taurus. But it is by no means unprecedented to have a sign with a ruler of different polarity: few would be reluctant to assign Saturn to Capricorn, yet here is a clearly masculine planet (although the most yin of the yang planets) assigned to a yin sign (although probably the most yang of the yin signs). All this means is that one cannot completely identify signs with their ruling planets.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As Capricorn is an extremely yang negative sign, so is Libra an extremely yin positive sign. In fact these two signs are so much at variance with their alleged polarities that they call the whole polarity idea into question. Nevertheless, I believe that the idea of polarity is sound. It is just that the polarity of a sign refers to a fairly specific attribute of the sign, not to the sum of all its attributes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As mentioned above, Zipporah Dobyns assigns the asteroids Pallas and Juno to Libra. The goddess Pallas Athena is a fighter and could represent the type of Libra whose one-to-one intimate confrontation takes the form of a fight. But I have not seen many Librans who operate this way, except for those with strong Mars or Pluto indications, and in these I suspect that the Libra indication has been overridden.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Juno is a better case, since among other things the goddess Juno was the patroness of marriage and wives. Marriage is definitely a Libran relationship. But the goddess Juno does not embody Libran traits such as the love of beauty, art, and harmony. Traditionally a sign of peace, Libra does not go well with the shrewish nature of Juno (or, for that matter, with the aggressive Pallas Athena). But arguments from mythology, unsupported by experience, are dangerous. Their resolution must be allowed to develop from observation of astrological effects.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Libra on Planets <span class="p">Obviously, planets in Libra increase the airy and cardinal qualities in a chart. Also, Libra is more favorable to planets that are relationship-oriented and generally peaceable in nature. Libra is at its worst with individualistic planets such as Mars. Mars in Libra does not know whether to go it alone and live its way, or try to get along in a Libran manner. It indicates someone likely to create intimate one-to-one relationships of the combative type.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark379">Oddly enough, Libra is the traditional sign of Saturn’s exaltation. There is a certain appropriateness here. Saturn is not a relationship-prone planet, of course, but it is not an individualistic one, either. Its role is to remind one of one’s connection to the greater social world. Saturn relates to Libra in that it stands for the obligations and duties of a relationship. It takes away the frivolous aspects of Libra and leaves the serious.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The recent transits of Neptune (1941-1956), Uranus (1968-1975), and Pluto (1970-1984) through Libra seem to symbolize the changes that have been occurring in our concepts of marriage. Neptune created an almost unrealizable idealization of one-to-one relationships while eliminating many of the social restrictions concerning them. The Neptune-in-Libra generation has been responsible for the widespread social acceptance of unmarried people living together, as well as the increasing respectability of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">240</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">homosexual relationships. Uranus and Pluto have been in Libra during the adulthood of those born with Neptune in Libra, and this well describes the actualization of what was portended by Neptune’s transit of this sign. Uranus symbolizing revolution and Pluto symbolizing breakdown suggest the increasing divorce rate and tendency toward multiple marriages. Clearly, a new view of human relationships is emerging from these transits.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In general, planets in Libra will bend the issues concerned with each planet more toward relationships and getting along with others. At the same time, planets in Libra will tend to operate in a lighter, less serious manner than in other signs (especially the next sign, Scorpio).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part92.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part94.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
