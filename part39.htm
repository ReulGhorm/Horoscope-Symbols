But they do not suddenly lose their linkage the moment they go a little bit out of exactitude. The extent to which an aspect can be out of exactitude and still have an effect is called the “orb” of the aspect. An orb is measured as the number of degrees you are willing to allow both before and after the exact aspect in the zodiac. Thus, if you use an orb of 5°, you are considering a planet to be in aspect if it is within a 10° range centering on the point where the aspect would be exact.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like many other matters in astrology, orbs have been the subject of much controversy because until recently astrologers have had no means of testing them rigorously. Now, however, with the advent of computers able to handle the vast numbers of charts that need to be analyzed in statistical testing, we are able to begin such tests. We are still in a rather primitive state with regard to this issue, because most astrologers lack the background</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to construct such tests correctly, but there are some preliminary results that can be reported.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">First of all, some old ideas are clearly wrong. One of these is a tendency among some astrologers to treat orbs like on-off switches, such that as soon as a planet comes within orb of another planet, the aspect turns on suddenly to full strength, and turns off just as abruptly when the faster planet moves out of orb on the other side. Put in this bald-faced way, I doubt that many astrologers would take this idea seriously, but in practice this is the way many use orbs in their work. They do this whenever they use an aspect that is far out of orb to explain a strong effect in the chart that they cannot otherwise account for. At such times, astrologers simply extend the orb out to that point and then treat the aspect as if it were in full force. But other factors can usually be adduced to explain such phenomena when they occur, as I will demonstrate further on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark183">It is clear both from clinical experience and research that orbs do not work this way. As a planet approaches the point of aspecting another, the linking effect gradually turns on and reaches a maximum when the aspect is exact or nearly so. Some research indicates that the linking effect peaks slightly before the point of exactitude, whereas work presented by Gary Duncan of California at the 1976 AFA convention indicates that in the case of squares, at least, the point of maximum linkage sometimes occurs after the point of exactness. And work with harmonics suggests that intensity may not decline linearly, but that the linking effect rises and falls at various points as the aspect moves out of orb. I suspect the precise answer depends on the way the question is asked. Fortunately, these seem to be subtleties one can ignore in practical astrological manipulation. Nevertheless, we should stay open to the possibility that anything said here or elsewhere may be invalidated by hard astrological research.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What the question boils down to is not how far out of orb an aspect can be and still have an effect, but rather how subtle a linkage one will accept as significant. The answer depends on what techniques you use. If you put together many small factors (which is the approach taken in this book), orbs should be small, because whatever faint effect the wide-orbed aspects have will be overwhelmed by other kinds of indications, such as those from midpoints. If you use fewer symbolic elements, then each indication has to bear a greater weight in forming the overall evaluation, and the subtle effects of wide-orbed aspects will be more important. Astrology is a language of nature that may be read in different ways by different people. This kind of variability according to the inclinations of the astrologer is one of the elements of astrology that scientists find</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">objectionable, though most psychologists would understand it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whether you use few or many symbolic elements determines the overall size range of the orbs you employ, but the orb of any particular aspect depends on several other considerations. Basically, there are two schools of thought about what determines the size of an orb: one emphasizes the size of the aspect, the other, what is being aspected. Most astrologers take both factors into account, but in varying proportions. Some also take into account whether the aspect is applying or separating. Further on, I will outline the rules for orbs that I find work best with my techniques, and I will close this section by discussing some exceptions to the general rules.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Determining the Orb by the Size of the Aspect <span class="p">There are two approaches to considering the size of the aspect: lumping aspects together into groups, or considering each aspect separately.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most traditional astrologers simply divide the aspects into major and minor. The major aspects, the conjunction, opposition, trine, square, and sextile, are all given the same, usually large orb, about 10°. Minor aspects, if used, are given varying orbs, commonly about 2°. The 10° orb is mainly a holdover from Renaissance astrology. Modern astrologers tend to cut orbs down to 7° or 8°, and a growing number now use even smaller orbs, 5° or less on the major aspects, 1° or less on the minors. I am basically of this last school, for reasons I will discuss further on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark184">Regardless of the maximum size of the orb employed, there is a problem with the above approach. Why should all the major aspects be lumped together and given the same orb? A sextile is only one-sixth of the circle. Should it not have one-sixth the orb of a conjunction? (For this discussion the conjunction should be regarded as an aspect of 360°, not 0°.) This problem is dealt with in Addey’s harmonic theory of aspects, mentioned earlier. According to Addey’s ideas, the size of an orb should be directly proportional to the harmonic on which the aspect is based. Thus, if the conjunction received a 10° orb, then an opposition (second harmonic) would receive a 5° orb, a square (fourth harmonic) a 2.5° orb, a trine (third harmonic) a 3.33° orb, and so on. Both the semisextile and the quincunx, being based on one-twelfth of the circle, would receive a 0.83° orb, and the semisquare and sesquiquadrate, being based on one-eighth of the circle, an orb of 1.25°.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This is a plausible idea, but it does not seem to accord with astrologers’ experiences. I am not saying it is incorrect, but some sort of compelling research would have to demonstrate it before I would be willing to accept it. In my judgment it makes the conjunction orb too large and the square, trine, semisextile, and quincunx orbs too small.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Determining the Orb by the Factors Involved <span class="p">There are two basic variations on this theme. Many authors advocate what is basically an orb-according-to-aspect method but increase the orbs for aspects involving the Sun and Moon. The difficulty is that most of those who advocate this approach give the Sun and Moon orbs of up to 15° to either side, which is a whole sign! As long as the maximum orb is not too huge, I find the idea defensible, though I do not accept it personally.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A more radical approach has been suggested by Reinhold Ebertin. In his book <i>Applied Cosmobiology </i>he divides all aspectable points in the chart into three categories. Personal points (Sun, Moon, Midheaven, and Ascendent) get 5°, fast-moving factors (Mercury, Venus, and Mars) get 4°, and slow-moving factors (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Moon’s nodes) get 3° orbs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Personal points are given the largest orb because of their importance in the chart, and because, with the exception of the Sun, they are the fastest moving factors. The Sun falls into this category only because of its importance (actually Mercury and Venus in the second category can go faster than the Sun). The second group consists of less powerful factors, but being rather fast moving, they move in and out of aspect quickly. The factors in the third group move slowly, staying within close orb of an aspect for a long time. Many people of the same age group will have the same aspects involving two or more of these factors. This makes such aspects less directly personal in their impact.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This manner of classifying aspects is based on the faster-moving of the two factors involved. If either of the two points is in group one, you use the 5° orb. If neither of the points is in group one, but either of them is in group two, you use the 4° orb. Otherwise, you use the 3° orb.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark185">The orbs described refer to the hard or two-series aspects only. All the two-series aspects, including the semisquare and sesquiquadrate, are given the same orb, depending on the factors involved. In other works, Ebertin gives consistent 5° orbs to all two-series aspects regardless of the points involved, and smaller orbs to the soft or three-series aspects. Clearly, his thinking has undergone several revolutions.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Applying versus Separating Aspects <span class="p">When the faster planet is moving toward the exact aspect but has not yet reached it, the aspect is said to be applying; when the faster planet has already made the exact aspect and is moving away from it, the aspect is said to be separating. Many astrologers use a larger orb for applying aspects than for separating ones.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is possibly a difference in quality between the two. By</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part40.htm#bookmark201" class="s31" name="bookmark186">progression, the applying aspect will increase in intensity in the years after birth as the faster-moving planet moves toward making the exact aspect. By transiting motion, these aspects usually become exact in the days after birth, which represent a critical time in one’s development.</a>* <span style=" color: #000;">Especially if they are “hard” or two-series aspects, applying aspects will signify energies that are intensifying and moving toward a crisis. When aspects are separating, the crisis is over. I suspect, though I cannot say I have observed this clearly, that applying two-series aspects are more turbulent than separating ones. Possibly because I already use small orbs, however, I do not find that the degree of interaction of the two points is any less when the aspect is separating, and for this reason I do not give separating aspects a smaller orb.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark187">Table 2 Suggested Orbs</a></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aspect Orb</h4><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Conjunction (0°) 5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Opposition (180°) 5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Trine (120°) 5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Square (90°) 5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sextile (60°) 3°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Semisquare (45°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sesquiquadrate (3 × 45°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Semisextile (30°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Quincunx (5 × 30°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Quintile (72°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Biquintile (2 × 72°) 1.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">22.5° multiples not covered above 0.5°</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All others 1° or less</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark188">The Orb Rules Used in This Book </a><span class="p">In general, I subscribe to the school that decreases the orb according to the size of the harmonic on which the aspect is based.

But </a><a href="part40.htm#bookmark202" class="s31">more recently, work by Geoffrey Dean of Australia has confirmed the 5° orb. Using a questionnaire in which people with various orbs were asked whether they could identify trait descriptions of aspects in themselves, he queried a fairly large sample and found that most of the effects that one would associate with a given major aspect disappeared when the aspect was more than 5° from exact.</a>* <span style=" color: #000;">Other authors report similar findings. Whatever orb you settle on, I think it safe to say that a very close aspect will show a stronger effect than one near the edge of orb.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part39.htm#bookmark187" class="s31">The orbs suggested in </a><a href="part39.htm#bookmark187" class="a">Table </a>2 <span style=" color: #000;">are only intended as guidelines. There are several cases in which they can be safely stretched.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Exception 1: When There Are Few Tight Orbs in the Chart<span class="p">. Geoffrey Dean also observes (and is reinforced by my friend and colleague, Nancy MacPhee) that the other aspects in the chart and their orbs are important in considering the orb of any one aspect. If there are a number of close-orbed aspects and several that are not close orbed, the close-orbed aspects will wipe out the effects of the wider-orbed ones. It is as if each aspect makes a noise that contributes to the overall sound of the chart. When the loud noises drown out the quiet tones, the quiet tones can be ignored. But if the chart does not have many loud noises, the quiet tones will be more important. Thus, when there are few close-orbed aspects in the chart, I recommend going beyond the 5° limit for the major aspects.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In this respect one should be careful not to overlook some of the not- so-minor minor aspects, notably the semisquare, sesquiquadrate, semisextile, and quincunx. One of these having a tight orb of less than 1° would outweigh by a considerable margin a square with a 6° orb. I also suspect that this is true of a quintile or biquintile, but I do not feel secure enough about the symbolism of these aspects to say for certain. Aside from the quintile and biquintile, then, these minor aspects are not really minor at all, but simply require smaller orbs.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark190">Exception 2: When the Aspect Involves a Harmonic Syndrome</a><span class="p">. In the case of a grand trine, grand square, T-square, or other pattern in which</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">several aspects are linked by the same family of aspects or harmonics, one can also allow a larger orb. Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules as to how much larger, but almost all astrologers agree on this. For example, if you usually allow a 5° orb to a square, then in a grand square, in which there are four planets, each about 90° apart in the zodiac, you can allow a larger orb.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This is particularly true if the average of all the orbs in the aspect complex is near 0°. To find the average of the orbs, you add up the number of degrees and minutes by which each aspect is out, assigning plus values to separating aspects and minus values to applying aspects. Dividing the total by the number of aspects involved gives the average of the orbs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As I said, out-of-orb aspects do not lose all effect, they just get subtle to the point that they are not worth considering. But in the case of aspect complexes linking several planets by the same harmonic, the effect of all the aspects is cumulative, and the subtle effects of wide-orbed aspects get boosted back to the point where they become significant again. The reason for this is apparent in harmonic theory: if aspects represent waves, then several waves peaking at the same points will reinforce each other.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Exception 3: When an Aspect Is Part of a Midpoint Configuration<a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">. When two planets are in aspect and another planet exactly (within a degree or so) bisects the arc between them, the linkage between the pair of planets is intensified. If the two planets are in an angle that would ordinarily be considered out of orb of an aspect, the effect of another planet at their midpoint can be enough to make the aspect strong enough to be noticed. A planet in hard aspect to the midpoint rather than actually on the midpoint can also cause this effect. The whole question of midpoints is discussed at length in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">8</span><span class="p">.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Orbs or Higher Harmonics? <span class="p">Though we do not yet know quite what to do with it in practical work, recent research into harmonics has raised another consideration about orbs. The work of John Addey and others makes it appear that wide-orbed aspects differ qualitatively as well as quantitatively from close-orbed aspects. Thus a square of 96° may have a nature quite different from a square of exactly 90°, because whereas 90° is based on the fourth harmonic, 96° is based on the fifteenth harmonic (4 × 360°/15 = 96°). Much research remains to be done, however, before we can use this in practical chart delineation.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part38.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part40.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
