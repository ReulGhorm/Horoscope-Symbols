And one must also be able to maintain one’s individuality in the face of pressures from the world and other members of society— pressures that threaten to violate one’s true nature or even survival itself. Nothing exists in nature without the energy of Mars enabling it to survive. Everything maintains its true nature through Mars energy. Mars energy is extemely individualistic, causing one to emphasize differences rather than similarities. This is one trait that Mars shares with Saturn.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In excess, Mars may cause one to attempt to survive by eliminating others who might compete. Thus, one person’s Mars may be a threat to another’s. This is the source of conflict: the inability of two people’s Mars energies to operate in the same space. Excess aggression is nothing more than an overabundance of survival energy, which feels it must control everything nearby. As we shall see, this is not really typical of Mars when it is functioning in a healthy manner.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like the Sun, Mars is a yang energy that enables one to get things done. But it is only effective when it works for an entity’s survival and self- expression. Mars’s energy is self-centered, not altruistic, but it can be transmuted to appear selfless. In war, for example, people may be willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of the state. But for this to happen, they must identify their own survival and their need to be whatever they are as a people with the survival of the nation. When the people become aware that a war is being fought solely for the benefit of the rulers, they will not fight with the same kind of selfless energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This brings us to one of the most peculiar attributes of Mars, its faculty of identification. In its crudest form, the energy of Mars is concerned with biological survival, but purely biological functions can become</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">metaphorized in the human mind. Aspects of life that have nothing to do with the original biological functions of an energy pattern, but which have symbolic structural parallels with the original function, become involved. An example of this (which has nothing to do with Mars) is the way in which the energies of orgasm, originally related to biological sexuality, become translated and metaphorized in the experience of religious ecstasy. Religious ecstasy is not orgasm, but the mind uses the vocabulary of orgasm in the experience. Similarly, Mars energy will be applied by the mind to matters that have little to do with pure survival, although they may have to do with survival on a psychological level.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The mind identifies its existence with the existence and survival of other entities around it or with things that the mind might be doing. In war, people individually and collectively identify with the state and transfer their Mars energies to it. By the same means, Mars energies may be transferred to one’s possessions, social status, career, credibility, reputation, or any number of other possible entities. In each case, however, one acts as if the entity in question were oneself in a concrete, biological sense. It is the “as if” aspect of the matter that leads me to use the term “metaphorization.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When one’s Mars energies are challenged, one reacts with the fight- or-flight syndrome. Adrenalin is released, and the body begins to react to a stressful situation in which it must either defend itself or run away. In ancient mythology, Mars (or Ares as he was called in Greek) was accompanied by Phobos and Deimos, fear and panic, which are now the names of the planet Mars’s moons. Fear and panic are aspects of the fight- or-flight syndrome, and are thus attributes of Mars. One only has to realize that all it takes to activate this side of Mars in many people is to put them up before a large group of people to speak. The body reacts to the crowd as if it were a predator. This makes clear the level of primitivism that may creep into our actions when we behave according to Mars’s energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although fear and panic are aspects of Mars’s energies, they do not represent its normal functioning. Mars normally is more fight than flight, and only when it is weakly placed in a chart is it likely to come out as fear. Fear comes from insecurity. Insecurity comes with a poorly operating Mars or Sun. Note, however, that a very strong-seeming Mars may disguise a weak one. Domineering or bullying behavior is not the normal style of an adequately strong Mars. Those who thrill to the glory of competition and enjoy testing their courage are really the ones in whom Mars is strong. They like to see how far they can go in any endeavor, and how strong they are with respect to others. The strongest Mars types of all have little desire to compare themselves to others. They prefer to improve on their own</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">performance, constantly becoming better and stronger.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Thus the Mars type is an individualist. Mars people do not want to compromise their own integrity by following a path set by another, so this type is often the first to go where none have gone before. The true Mars type wants neither to dominate nor be dominated, but wishes to be left alone, free to pursue whatever path is desired. For this reason, however, the Mars type may have difficulty in relationships, especially work relationships. In love relationships the Mars type needs a partner who is an independent equal, capable of going his or her own way when necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Women will often experience their own Mars energies through men. Hence Mars, like the Sun, is said to rule males. This is also changing as women become more in touch with their own yang energies. But anyone can experience Mars through other people who are associated with force, strength, and vigor. Thus Mars traditionally signifies athletes, military people, police in their forceful aspect, and the like, and also, less obviously, things like iron and steel (used by military people and in powerful machines) and those who work with them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In a healthy body, Mars represents the vigor and vitality of movement, and especially the muscles. But it can also manifest as irritations, inflammations, infections, and fevers. Mars can be one of the principal significators of operations and accidents. These difficulties only manifest when for some reason the normal psychological channels for Mars’s expression are blocked.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark93">As we have already mentioned in connection with Venus, Mars has a vital role to play in love. Obviously, as the planet of conflict, it does not symbolize love itself. But it is necessary for love: only people who have realized their Mars, who have formed and defined their individuality and learned to maintain it in the face of resistance, can truly love and be loved. Love has a self-expressive quality as much as a quality of merging with another. In fact, in many animals, including human beings, there is a strong connection between sexual behavior and fighting. The intensity of sexual passion is the result simultaneously of the expression of selfish energies (Mars) and an experience of merging (Venus). Keeping the balance between these two energies is one of the difficulties in sexual relationships. Men in particular, who traditionally are more identified with the Mars facet of sexuality, may act selfishly in love relationships, exploiting and using women. Women, on the other hand, who have traditionally been identified with the Venus aspect of sexuality, may demand too little of a relationship and may allow themselves to be exploited. This, too, is changing, as both sexes are becoming increasingly aware of the need to experience both Venus</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and Mars in sexual expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This brings us to an important point which has not been made clear in older texts. Neither Venus nor Mars alone is the planet of sexuality. It is the combination of the two that rules sexual passion. And other planets, including Pluto, have lesser roles to play. It is not correct to describe Mars as masculine sexuality and Venus as feminine sexuality, except with respect to very primitive notions of sexuality. Ideally, both sexes should manifest both energies. The complete human being will always have a strong Mars balanced by a strong Venus, and will be able to avoid extremes of conflict and passivity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part25.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part27.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
