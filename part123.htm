Not only does this house have a malefic reputation, it is also traditionally the weakest house, such that any planet placed in it is supposed to be of little or no use to the individual. Yet it is clear from the difficulties that people have with twelfth-house planets that it is not a weak house. Planets in this house often signify one’s most serious difficulties in a way they could not do if they were weak.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In more recent times Gauquelin’s work has demonstrated that as an indicator of profession and temperament, at least, the twelfth house is one of the strongest areas of the chart. Clearly, some sort of reevaluation is in order; I attempt one here and elsewhere in this book.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">As I shall show in the next chapter, we can look at houses as a sequence of evolutionary stages not only in the traditional counterclockwise order starting with the first house, but also clockwise, starting at the I.C. and moving up into the third, second, first, twelfth, and back around to the fourth. I raise this point now because, of all houses, the twelfth is made clearest by this scheme. Planets rise into the twelfth from the first after crossing the horizon in the east. The twelfth is where the Sun is just after dawn. This fact does not square with the traditional view of the twelfth as a dark, hidden, secret house. Dawn is not dark! But dawn <i>is </i>the first, tentative manifestation of the energy that has just come forth from the personal, inward hemisphere below the horizon. The twelfth is the house in which we first put energies out into the world. Such energies are immature, inexperienced, vulnerable, and easily defeated, but they do not have a weak effect on the personality. On the contrary, they are at a critical point and consequently have a strong, though sometimes hidden effect. If these energies become the focus of a crisis early in life, the negative consequences of such a crisis can be especially severe. We can look at such</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a situation in the following manner.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Consider the newly risen energies in the twelfth house to be the individual’s first tentative attempts to put something out into the world. Vulnerable and inexperienced efforts, they are easily countered by more established energies and are often defeated. If so, the individual either consciously or unconsciously pulls these fledgling energies back into the inner self.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When a person consciously decides not to express one of these energies, it becomes one of the individual’s secrets. More commonly, the individual cannot accept the energy as part of the self and so represses it into the unconscious mind.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But unacceptable energies must still manifest. If the conscious mind is unwilling or unable to accept them, they have only two places left to surface: the body, in which case the twelfth house becomes a house of sickness similar to the sixth, or the environment, in which case the energies manifest as other individuals who embody what one oneself fears. In other words, those aspects of the world that work against one—one’s secret enemies, both individual and circumstantial—are nothing but embodiments of rejected aspects of oneself. They are rendered evil not by their intrinsic nature, but by one’s rejection of them. This phenomenon has been noticed by depth psychologists. Any aspect of one’s psychic energy that is not integrated into the whole system of psychic energy that makes up one’s being becomes autonomous and alien. It is experienced either as something within that feels external, like possession by a spirit, or as something that appears totally external, such as a circumstance or person.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The twelfth house, insofar as it is a house of repressed and therefore unintegrated energies, is a house of the unconscious mind, of the personal unconscious, of one’s private garbage heap. This is opposed to the fourth- house idea of the collective unconscious, the aspect of the psyche that is inherently unconscious rather than unconscious because of repression.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Energies that have been subjected to the twelfth-house process of repression are part of the self but not of the conscious identity. They confine one by working against one’s expression. They undermine one’s ego because they are denied by it. To the extent that one is attached to one’s ego (or, more accurately, to the extent that one <i>is </i>rather than <i>has </i>an ego) and to the extent that one considers one’s social identity to be what one truly is, the repressed energies of the twelfth house will work against one. Only insofar as one is able to detach oneself from the ego can these energies be made to work in one’s favor. From the ego’s point of view this is sacrifice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Practically speaking, this means that in order to deal with twelfth- house energies that have been a source of difficulty, it may be necessary to do work with them in a way in which one’s credit and reward is not an issue. This means altruistic work, done for another’s sake or for a cause that goes beyond any individual. Working at a level higher than ordinary consciousness can understand, this activity will integrate twelfth-house energies into one’s life and will enlarge and strengthen one’s being. It is for this reason that many astrologers associate the twelfth house with sacrifice, spiritual work, and even enlightenment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Karma as a meaning of the twelfth house comes from this same source. I believe that whatever energies may hang over from previous lives, the patterns associated with them are restated very early in this life. If it is</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">difficult karma, these patterns are likely to be associated with some kind of twelfth-house difficulty.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I would like to take this opportunity to condemn what is called “karmic astrology.” Many of its practitioners have taken to reading the twelfth house in terms of negative karma, that is, conditions that limit and structure this life without the individual being able to do anything but endure the consequences. Most often a limitation in this life is viewed as a punishment for sins of a past life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This practice has several pernicious consequences. First, it is usually a projection onto the cosmos of the practitioner’s own, usually primitive, Judeo-Christian morality. The astrologer speaks as a righteous prophet laying down the “word of God” to the client. This makes the client feel wrong and inadequate, and actually worsens the problems associated with the twelfth house, which is, to begin with, a house of rejected aspects of the self.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Second, because there is no reliable way of validating a previous incarnation, clients are put in the position of having to believe or disbelieve what they have been told. If they disbelieve, there may still be a lingering doubt that will weaken their ability to cope with the problem. If they believe, they are deprived of the opportunity to do anything about the problem. After all, what can one do about divine punishment? Also, being preoccupied with karmic causes, one is less likely to be in touch with experiences in this life that later on may throw light on the problem and enable one to do something about it. Astrologers exist to help those who want to understand and do something about their lives. They do not exist to dispense divine judgments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most of the above assumes that the energies of the twelfth house have been defeated in crises, resulting in repression and alienation of the self from the self. This is not always the case. In many people twelfth-house energies are not defeated in early life. For such people, twelfth-house planets become a source of strength, not difficulty, and come to signify dominant energies in their personalities and lives. This explains why the twelfth house can determine profession, and, what is even more important, dominant psychological characteristics, as shown in the research of Gauquelin.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">Whereas in the first house we have the potential for putting energy out into the world, in the twelfth we have the energies that are actually put out. These energies can become sources of early-life defeats or victories, either of which may come to dominate the life. When defeated, these energies become part of our repressed or unacknowledged self, and</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">324</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">their lack of integration with the conscious self may cause them to work against us and thereby to surface as our fears. When seen, these aspects of the self are seen as evil, or at best weaknesses. Often they are not seen at all, but can only be deduced from one’s behavior or from the circumstances one draws to oneself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In working out twelfth-house problems, it often helps for the ego to sacrifice itself in a way that is symbolically appropriate to the energies involved. Thus the individual can integrate these energies into the self at a level higher than the ego. In this way the twelfth house may tell as much about self-transcendence as the tenth. The tenth can signify the direction of self-transcendence, while the twelfth can tell what we have to do in order to go in that direction.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">The twelfth house is very important at the self- other level because we often project the hidden aspects of ourselves onto our intimate relationships. In fact, the twelfth often tells as much as the seventh about intimate relationships, in that we are often driven into dealings with people who embody what we fear in ourselves. It is as if our non-integrated parts are seeking reunion with the rest of ourselves by coming back into life through another individual. Needless to say, such relationships are often difficult, because, being estranged from the twelfth- house aspects of oneself, one will have difficulty with anyone who embodies them. The people to whom we relate in this way are often like mirrors, able to tell us much about ourselves once we accept their relationship to us. Unless we accept their being a manifestation of ourselves, however, we will see ourselves as victims of their activity.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are also positive twelfth-house relationships in which one serves another—not out of victimhood or martyrdom, but out of devotion. In such relationships, the negative energies of the twelfth house are transcended as they become symbols of something beyond the individual.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At the outer level of the twelfth house are all social circumstances and situations that are difficult because we find them undermining. These, too, are projections of our inner fears and sense of inadequacy.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark485">The twelfth house can also represent social entities and circumstances that assist us in overcoming the consequences of our twelfth- house energies. These include hospitals and other institutions that care for us when we are in trouble with ourselves. They also include teachers and spiritual institutions. Through these, we can overcome our twelfth-house difficulties by learning to transcend our egos, recover the lost parts of</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">325</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ourselves, and expand those parts so they are capable of digesting and integrating the once-unacceptable energies.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Twelfth House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the twelfth house means that a number of planets are in a critical stage. Since most people have difficulty handling several crises at once, it is likely that a person with many twelfth-house planets will fail to resolve some of the crises, and the planets that represent them will then become part of the negative twelfth-house energies discussed above.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One cannot usually deduce solely from the chart whether a twelfth- house energy will be a positive or a negative force. Contrary to what many astrologers believe, a twelfth-house energy is not necessarily difficult, and when it works positively, it is not limited to spiritual, self-denying, or ascetic activities. Take, for example, the Sun in the twelfth, the usual description of which indicates a retiring, withdrawn individual who prefers to be alone and who shuns the limelight. According to the birth data generally accepted, however, Jimmy Carter, Rosalynn Carter, and Henry Kissinger all have twelfth-house Suns. Of course, Kissinger has worked in a secretive manner, and the Carters have strong religious concerns and a greater than usual sense of privacy than have most people in politics. But none of these people can be called a shunner of the limelight (especially Kissinger, who seems to have greatly enjoyed being a public figure). These three cases as well as the Gauquelin data clearly indicate that not only can twelfth-house planetary energies be very evident in a personality, they can also work for, not against, an individual’s ego expression so long as they have not been the subject of a major ego defeat early in life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It must be acknowledged, however, that twelfth-house energies are often difficult for people to handle, and that many never do learn to use them effectively except possibly altruistically with little concern for personal gain. Each planet in the twelfth can indicate an energy from which one is alienated.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark486">This is especially true if cultural or social conditions tend to work against the expression of that planetary energy in the individual. For example, for those who believe in traditional sex roles, Mars is too masculine an energy for women to express. Mars in the twelfth on top of the prevalent sexual stereotyping makes it doubly likely that a woman will be alienated from her own Mars energy, and will experience it through the men she attracts. Such men may be strong, aggressive, and independent, or, more likely, harsh, domineering, and arrogant. Usually Mars characteristics experienced in this way are negative, because the repression that the twelfth house symbolizes makes an energy negative. For men, the Moon or Venus in</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the twelfth may be difficult, at least in relationships with women, because, again, the repressive tendencies of the negative twelfth house reinforce the social training that puts men out of touch with their femininity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part122.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part124.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
