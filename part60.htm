Whether you use dials or listings is largely a matter of personal preference; both have their advantages. The chief bar to lists in the past was the tedious calculation they required, but this is no longer a real obstacle because many computer chart-casting services and home computer programs routinely offer midpoint listings in addition to the regular chart. Using a listing showing the actual zodiacal position of each pair of factors in the chart together with a listing known as a 45° sort, you can see all the hard aspects and all the midpoints attached to any axis just as you can with dials. The advantage of listings is that you do not have to draw dial-type charts; you can get along, at least for natal work, with a twelve-equal-wedges chart easily drawn by you or a computer. Also, you have all positions exact to the minute of arc, which helps in judging orbs accurately (particularly important in research work) and in timing transits and directions. The disadvantage of lists is mainly when you want to compare the natal chart to transits or directions for a number of different times in someone’s life; ways can be devised for computers to make this easier, but using dials is generally the more convenient method in such a case.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 306pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="420" height="408" alt="image" src="Image_045.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark263">Figure 24. Finding midpoints in Bob Dylan’s 90° chart</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Zodiacal Listing <a href="part61.htm#bookmark267" class="s31">The triangular array labeled “Halfsums or Midpoints” in </a><a href="part61.htm#bookmark267" class="a">Figure </a><span class="s24">25 </span><span class="p">lists the degree, sign, and minute in the zodiac of all Bob Dylan’s midpoints. It is arranged so that by finding where the vertical and horizontal columns cross you can immediately find any midpoint or single factor. To locate the position of Bob Dylan’s Sun/Moon midpoint, you simply find the column headed “Su” for “Sun” and run down it until you find the line headed “Mo” for “Moon.” Where the Sun column and the Moon line cross it says “27Tau31”, which is the degree, sign, and minute of Bob Dylan’s Sun/Moon midpoint.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The zodiacal listing does not reveal which midpoints are in aspect to which other midpoints. Its chief use is as an index for locating the true zodiacal position of midpoints shown in the 45° sort.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The 45° Sort The 45° <span class="p">sort is based on the same principle as the 90° dial, except that in this case the zodiac is divided into eight parts instead of four before the parts are laid on top of each other. This means that the list goes from 0° Aries through 14°59’59” Taurus, then starts at the beginning again for 15° Taurus through 29°59’59” Gemini, then starts at the beginning again for 0° Cancer through 14°59’59” Leo, etc.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The reason the listing is in a 45° instead of a 90° modulus is that</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">whereas the 90° dial makes semisquares and sesquiquadrates readily apparent at the opposite end from the feathered pointer, a listing cannot do this. A listing must make the semisquares and sesquiquadrates as well as the squares and oppositions look like conjunctions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A 45° sort mingles all the midpoints and single factors from each of the eight segments of the zodiac together into one listing in ascending degree order. Thus factors that are in any hard aspect to each other will be next to each other in the list.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="h4">Using the 45° Sort to Investigate Midpoint Axes </span><a href="part61.htm#bookmark267" class="s31">The bottom of </a><a href="part61.htm#bookmark267" class="a">Figure </a>25 <a href="part61.htm#bookmark267" class="s31">shows a computer printout of Bob Dylan’s 45° sort.

We locate the Sun/Moon midpoint in the zodiacal listing as described above, and find it to be 27°31’ Taurus. Using the rules in </a><a href="part60.htm#bookmark264" class="a">Table </a>6 <span style=" color: #000;">we translate the number of degrees the midpoint is in its sign into a 45° sort position. Since 27°31’ Taurus is in the second half of a fixed sign, we subtract 15° from it, getting 12°31’ in the 45° sort, and sure enough, it is the Sun/Moon midpoint.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark264">Table 6</a></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 43pt;text-align: justify;">Translating Zodiacal Longitudes into 45° Sort Longitudes</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cardinal Signs: Degrees are the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: -120pt;text-align: left;">Fixed Signs: First half (through 14°59’): add 30 to degrees in sign.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">Second half (from 15°00’): subtract 15 from degrees in sign.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mutable Signs: Add 15 to degrees in sign.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Now we can instantly see all the midpoints and other factors that are in some hard aspect to the Sun/Moon axis. We simply read off all the factors that are just above and below “Su/Mo” in the list, stopping when we reach the end of our 1° orb for indirect midpoints. Reading up from “Su/Mo,” we find “As/Vx” (Ascendant/Vertex—this computer program includes the Vertex, which we will not use here), “Su/Sa” (Sun/Saturn), and Uranus. We continue reading up for another 30’ to find any midpoints that might be direct and therefore allowable within our 1.5° orb for direct midpoints. We find “Pl/As” (Pluto/Ascendant). To see what kind of hard aspect Pluto/Ascendant makes to Sun/Moon, we need to check the number of degrees in their signs of both midpoints in the zodiacal listing. Going back</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to the zodiacal listing, we find Sun/Moon at “27Tau31” and Pluto/Ascendant at “11Lib21.” This is a sesquiquadrate, so we discard Pluto/Ascendant because it is too far out of orb for an indirect midpoint.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Reading down from “Su/Mo,” we have “Me/Pl” (Mercury/Pluto), “Ma/Sa” (Mars/Saturn), “Ju/Ur” (Jupiter/Uranus), and “Me/Vx” (Mercury/Vertex—which we won’t use) within our 1° orb for indirect midpoints. Looking as far as 30’ further down (up to 14 01) within our 1.5° orb for direct midpoints, we find “Ne/Pl” (Neptune/Pluto) and “Mo/Ma” (Moon/Mars). Again, we check the zodiacal listing to see whether these factors are tied to the Sun/Moon axis directly or indirectly. Neptune/Pluto turns out to be at “28Leo40,” which is in square to Sun/Moon, and Moon/Mars is at “13Lib45,” which is sesquiquadrate, so neither of these midpoints is allowable. We are now ready to write out the midpoints connected to Sun/Moon.</p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sun/Moon = Sun/Saturn = Uranus = Mercury/Pluto = Mars/Saturn = Jupiter/Uranus</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The principle of the 45° sort can be used to highlight aspects that are multiples of any angle. One could have 30° sorts, 22.5° sorts (sometimes used by Uranian astrologers in this country), 15° sorts, or whatever. Sorts would be especially valuable in finding multiples based on fifths or sevenths of the circle, which are very hard to examine in the conventional mode of representation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part59.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part61.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
