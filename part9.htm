There are religious sects and philosophies that consider astrology to be somehow immoral, or at best a deviation from the path one should follow. The Bible, interpreted literally, occasionally condemns astrology, though in books like Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation the symbols of astrology and numerology are rife. The condemnations are either general condemnations of divination (that is, fortunetelling, not divination in the sense it has been used here) or statements to the effect that if a genuine prophet of God is available, one should heed the prophet rather than an astrologer. I am inclined to agree with this: genuinely enlightened teachers are indeed better sources of guidance than most astrologers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark24">Christianity has been ambivalent about astrology both because of the Biblical criticism and because of its own theological emphasis on free will. One must be free in order to choose whether or not to accept salvation. Salvation becomes a cruel joke if the position of the planets at birth determines whether one achieves it. Both the Biblical and the Christian criticisms are in fact concerned with the doctrine of the planets as absolute determinants of one’s fate. Most astrologers would not accept this doctrine. From what has been said already, it should be clear that horoscope symbols only indicate certain aspects of one’s style of being, and that these are only indications, not causes. One still has the responsibility for determining one’s destiny, even if one is not aware of this. One has complete responsibility for achieving one’s own salvation, enlightenment, or whatever one’s religious tradition chooses to call it.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some might object that I am giving the individual too much power. I believe the individual is powerful, but also that the individual is the route through which the will of the universe is made manifest. I do not separate humankind from the divine and oppose the two. That, I feel, may be a fundamental error in philosophy and religion, especially in the West. This error has been the root of many evils. Only by believing in the opposition of the will of human beings to that of the universe can one create the sense of evil with which many approach the world. This belief has created Satan, who has no existence beyond the consciousness of those who give him power by believing in him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part8.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part10.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
