This form has house cusps and all other factors placed around the circle in their true, rather than approximate, zodiacal longitudes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Not only does the 360° dial make midpoint work easy, it also provides a valuable fringe benefit as a mechanical aspectarian. While the conventional method of chart drawing using sign notation lends itself to seeing traditional aspects which are all multiples of 30°, it does not lend itself to seeing aspects like quintiles, semisquares, sesquiquadrates, or aspects based on the seven-series or nine-series. A 360° dial can be marked to show any kind of aspect you might wish to investigate and can make its presence in a chart very clear.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Drawing the 360° Chart <span class="p">To draw this chart, you need a 360° protractor or mechanical aspectarian with a hole in the exact center. Some people prefer a pinhole which they use with a thumbtack; others prefer a larger hole which fits a type of set-screw available from some astrological suppliers. The center of the paper on which one draws the chart is impaledon the tack or screw, and then the dial is fitted over this with the tack or screw coming up through its center hole.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">166</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part58.htm#bookmark256" class="s31">To draw the chart you also need either an ordinary ruler which you line up between the center hole and the degree marking of the planet you are drawing in, or a specially made ruler (such as the one in </a><a href="part58.htm#bookmark256" class="a">Figure </a>21<span style=" color: #000;">) that fits over the tack or set-screw. With one of these you will be making short lines on the paper from the rim of the dial outward. These lines will indicate the position of each factor in the chart.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part58.htm#bookmark256" class="s31" name="bookmark255">Begin by turning the dial so that the approximate degree of the Midheaven is at the top of the paper. Now find 0° Aries and make your first mark there. While you are drawing the chart you will want to keep the dial’s 0° Aries mark exactly on the paper’s 0° Aries mark at all times. If you are using a set-screw you can tighten it to keep the dial from turning; if you are using a thumbtack hold the dial down firmly. Now, being sure that all the lines you draw point outward from the exact center of the dial, make short lines indicating as closely as possible the exact zodiacal degree and minute of each house cusp and other factor in the chart. Then you can write in the glyphs and longitudes for all the factors next to their lines at the same time as you check each line to see that you have drawn its position correctly.

The feathered arrow is at the Sun/Moon midpoint.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using the 360° Dial to Find Midpoints <a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="s31">The dial originally used for placing the planets in the chart is now used as a measuring tool. To find the midpoint of any two factors in the chart, simply turn the dial so its pointer (the feathered arrow) is approximately halfway between the two factors. Now, using the degree markings on either side of the pointer as a guide, adjust the dial so the degrees on either side are exactly equal. </a><a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="a">Figure 22 </a><a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="s31">shows the dial turned to indicate the location of Dylan’s </a><span class="p">Sun/Moon midpoint.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As you can see, the pointer is very near Uranus. In fact, Uranus is on the Sun/Moon midpoint well within the 1.5° orb I allow for direct midpoints. We therefore write:</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sun/Moon = Uranus</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To get an idea of what this might mean in the chart, you can look in the next chapter at the brief delineations given for Sun/Moon, Sun/Uranus, and Moon/Uranus.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Now you can check what other midpoints lie along the Sun/Moon axis. To do so, leave the feathered arrow on the Sun/Moon midpoint and scan to one side of the midpoint until you encounter another point. Note the arc between that point and the midpoint. Then scan in the opposite direction to see if there is another point the same number of degrees away from the midpoint. If there is one within 3° of the same arc length, the midpoint of these two points will be within 1.5° orb of the Sun/Moon midpoint. This is because a midpoint is found by splitting the arc between two points into two equal arcs. If the original arc is increased by a certain number of degrees, the midpoint will move half that number of degrees. Therefore, the difference between two arcs on opposite sides of an axis must always be within twice the orb of the midpoint configuration.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We find that the midpoint of Jupiter/Uranus is well within a degree of Sun/Moon. And so is the midpoint of Sun/Saturn. All these direct midpoints are plainly visible using the 360° dial. We now have:</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sun/Moon = Uranus = Jupiter/Uranus = Sun/Saturn</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There may also be indirect midpoints in square, semisquare, or sesquiquadrate to the Sun/Moon midpoint. To check for squares, keep the feathered arrow on the Sun/Moon midpoint and find the two unfeathered arrows in square to the pointer (these will have “180” and “360” written on their lines). These two arrows are two ends of a single axis that is in square to the direct axis. Just as you looked along the direct axis for direct midpoints, look for indirect midpoints along the axis in square to the direct</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">168</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">axis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To check for semisquares and sesquiquadrates, find the four large</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dots midway between the four arrows. These dots are the ends of two more axes, each of which is semisquare/sesquiquadrate the direct axis. Look along both of these axes for midpoints or single factors that are semisquare/sesquiquadrate the direct axis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 325pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="420" height="433" alt="image" src="Image_043.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark257">Figure 22. Finding midpoints in Bob Dylan’s 360° chart</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="s31">In Bob Dylan’s chart there are no midpoints within a 1° orb of square to Sun/Moon, but Mercury/Pluto and Mars/Saturn are both semisquare/sesquiquadrate the Sun/Moon axis within the 1° orb allowable for indirect midpoints (see </a><a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="a">Figure </a>22<span style=" color: #000;">). We can thus show all the midpoints connected to the Sun/Moon midpoint as follows:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sun/Moon = Uranus = Jupiter/Uranus = Sun/Saturn = Mercury/Pluto = Mars/Saturn</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The sum total of all the midpoints and points tied to a given point or midpoint is usually called an axis. We have just been looking at the Sun/Moon axis of Bob Dylan’s horoscope. Although all the above midpoints may be within the allowed 1.5° and 1° orbs of being in aspect to Sun/Moon,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they are not necessarily within orb of each other. The first point in such a listing is always the center of the orb spread.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Looking at four separate axes to find all the direct and indirect midpoint combinations may seem laborious, but in actual practice we are going to be primarily concerned with direct midpoints. The indirect midpoints we reserve for detailed work. It is therefore not usually necessary to tally all midpoint aspects to a given point. Also, as we said above, the 90° dial greatly simplifies finding the indirect midpoints.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part57.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part59.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
