If Uranus breaches the normal reality structure and Neptune exposes us to the ultimately real, then Pluto symbolizes the radical transformation of consciousness and being that must result. Pluto is the archetype of death and resurrection: it breaks down the old and outworn entities into their component parts, and then reassembles them into new being.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It does this at every level of life. As with Uranus and Neptune, Pluto may be experienced by people of any level of consciousness, but, also like these other planets, Pluto is hard to handle if one is bound up in the universe of Saturn. Pluto operates with extreme power, and, being a force beyond the ego, when it manifests it usually causes one to feel out of control. While Uranus interrupts normal reality and Neptune confuses ordinary reality by</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">exposing one to other realities, Pluto can symbolize a complete breakdown in ordinary reality. Such a breakdown forces one not only to deal with an alternate reality, but even to build a new day-to-day reality out of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When faced with the breakdowns of Pluto, people often draw on all their reserves to hold together what is disintegrating. But this only makes the breakdown difficult and even deadly, and frustrates the new birth. Mental illness is often an example of this: psychotic episodes have been observed in people’s lives when the power of Pluto is strong. There comes a time when the mind’s old structures no longer work and the only hope is to destroy them and build new ones. But people who experience psychotic breakdowns, and even more often those around them, tend to be overwhelmed by the pain of the situation. They panic and resort to tranquilizing drugs. The breakdown is slowed and the confrontation that must occur cannot. The rebuilding process is delayed or even prevented. The sick individual then falls into a state of arrested development hovering between madness and sanity, and never completely builds a structure that can work. This is typical of the ways in which many people react to Plutonian crises in general. It is best to let go of whatever must go at such times and work to hasten the birth of the new. Like Uranus and Neptune, Pluto requires detachment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike Uranus, however, Pluto is not usually sudden in its effects. Pluto represents an evolutionary power built into the nature of things. Living things develop: they grow, die, decay, and are changed into something else. At least at this point, there is no way of frustrating this cycle of development. Non-living things also develop: waves crest, break, and re- form into new waves; stars condense, shine, expand, explode, and die; rocks form, wear, and are reincorporated into new rocks. Cultures rise, fall, and become the seeds of new cultures. On the Earth, the great continental plates shift and collide, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which are Plutonian insofar as they change the face of the Earth (and Uranian in their suddenness). Nothing in a universe of change can long remain unchanged, and most of that change comes from the very nature of what is changed. It is inherent in the growth processes of the human psyche as well that there will be times when the psyche must undergo crises involving breakdown and rebirth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">People who strongly manifest the energies of Pluto are often the agents of Plutonian power in the world. They embody the forces of death and resurrection inherent in society. Uranian types may talk of revolution and the need for change, but it is the Plutonian types who will often bring it about, taking advantage of energies stirring within the culture. Plutonians,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unlike Uranians, will often work quietly behind the scenes manipulating the process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But most Plutonians are not political revolutionaries. They are usually quiet people who nevertheless strangely attract and repel others. From them comes a fascinating quality that many find charismatic and others find unsettling, disgusting, or even horrifying.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark109">One aspect of Plutonian death and resurrection is sexuality. The purpose of sexual reproduction is to keep the species going even though its individual members die. Two individuals each shed cells containing the genetic makeup of each. The cells then merge and lose their separate identities and are eventually born as a new entity. The period of gestation in the womb can be likened to the body’s period in the tomb, except that in the womb the body is built up, while in the tomb it is disintegrating. The important point is that change takes place, slowly and subtly, from one state to another, change that eventually becomes visible. Many students of symbolism have noted the connection between orgasm and death. At the simplest physiological level, orgasm is the turning point of a process that goes from excitation to release. At its most complete, it involves a momentary annihilation of the ego, followed by a feeling of renewed aliveness. So to the personal aspects of sexuality that are associated with Mars and Venus we must add the transcendental aspect of Pluto.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Plutonians are often sexually magnetic, though not always in conventional ways. Such individuals may or may not be what we commonly think of as physically attractive; their magnetism arises because they embody an aspect of the life-death force. Plutonian sexuality may or may not follow the conventional social guidelines concerning sex.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When you manifest Plutonian energies, you are intended by the universe to fulfill a cosmic purpose. When you try to bend Pluto’s energies to your own ends, you find that the original intentions of the energy, those that were inherent in the energy itself as opposed to those that you had in mind, are fulfilled instead. Not only do you fail to gain your individual ends, you may destroy yourself in the process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Often Plutonian people are found in politics. The force of history requires individuals who will manifest Pluto’s power. And those who are selected, feeling that power, will usually try to bend it to their own ends. As a result, they often achieve a great deal of political power, even though in retrospect it can be seen that they themselves were not in control. Hitler, with his ability to hypnotize the masses with oratory, is an example. He rose as a manifestation of a historical process from the tensions that gripped Europe after World War I. But he believed that he was as an individual the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">source of that power, and his people believed it, too. The result was destruction.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is tempting to believe that Hitler and the German people broke a moral law and were punished. But there is nothing moral or ethical about the energy of Pluto. It is a force of nature that is simply too strong to be contained by the limited capacities of the ego. Any attempt to harness its energy to the ends of the ego results in an overload, as in a circuit that carries more electricity than it was designed for. Hitler could have been a medium for the transmission of historical energies, but he chose to try to take control of them. World War II was the consequence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Richard Nixon also attempted to use his great Plutonian power for his own purposes. Unlike Hitler, however, almost from the beginning he provoked a steady and persistent opposition, one that worked as tirelessly to bring down his power as he had worked to build it up. This is the more common response to those who abuse Plutonian power. The opposition usually builds up faster than it did with Hitler. People with strong Plutos need to be careful how they manifest their energy, and how others react to it. In Nixon’s case the effects of both his natal Pluto and the Pluto in the sky at the time of Watergate were important in timing his downfall. (This is discussed at length in my book <i>Planets in Transit</i>.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As Pluto is connected to breakdown and decay, so it is also connected to those elements of society that reflect breakdown and decay. This is the source of Pluto’s association with underworld elements, organized crime, and people who are so socially disaffected that they represent a threat to society. Terrorism is a manifestation of Pluto; it comes about because the world is unwilling to deal with certain pressing problems. At this point in history the right of the Jews to a state of their own is colliding with the right of the Palestinian Arabs to the country from which they were expelled when the Jewish state was created. Terrorism has resulted because the world is unwilling to deal with this problem. The socially disaffected are only a manifestation of Pluto’s power. Though criminals and terrorists seem to be what destroys society, they are merely the agents by which the destructive power already inherent in the situation manifests. They are not the source of destruction, and even if they were eliminated, something else would replace them as agents of that power.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In individual life, Plutonian periods are always periods of death, but generally not physical death. Usually an aspect of one’s life passes away, making way for something new. Or an individual may experience an increase in power that causes life to be totally transformed. As we have said, the best thing one can do is surrender to the change and even assist it if</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Very often, Plutonian people take on the positive role of assisting others who are going through Plutonian transformations. At one level, then, Pluto is associated with healers and therapists, both psychological and physical, and those who teach techniques of self-transformation. At another level, Plutonians may appear as religious leaders who stress rebirth after death — either literal or psychological. Therapists, healers, gurus, religious leaders, and the like are the most positive Plutonians of all because they are the most in touch with the central theme of Pluto, the death and rebirth of the soul.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Helping others with their transformations is a constructive way to use Pluto, but it still has its dangers. To assist people in this way involves having a great deal of power, especially because of the knowledge such helpers gain of their clients’ vulnerable spots, and the weakened condition of those undergoing crises. When Plutonians exploit this power for personal ends, they are likely to suffer the consequences. Insofar as they assist people in transforming their lives, astrologers are Plutonian and also have this responsibility.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark110">One discipline that illustrates all of Pluto’s dangers is magick (spelled this way to distinguish it from what stage magicians do). Even when pursued purely for the sake of enlightenment, magick grants a power likely to corrupt. Therefore, those who wish to study it must purify themselves of all considerations that might cause them to use the power for personal ends. If these energies are misused, they may destroy the practitioner. For those who might be unaware of the fact, magick is not supernatural in the usual sense of the word. It is a study of psychic energies in their highest form. The knowledge that one gains from its study is dangerous to the extent that the magician falls short of perfect psychological balance. And this is the way it is with Plutonian energies in general. Whether they manifest as magick or anything else, Plutonian energies cannot be used for purely personal ends.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The literature of astrology tends to dwell on the seamy side of Pluto, its association with unchecked power, decay, corruption, and death. Yet Pluto stands for something much higher. It is the purifying fire that an entity must go through in order to pass from one level of being to another. Ultimately, Pluto purifies and makes more nearly perfect; but to do this it must first completely destroy anything gross or imperfect that holds an entity back. When we confront Plutonian energies, we often see aspects of ourselves with which we cannot deal, because we have buried them in the process of creating our reality systems. So when a crisis comes in which</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nothing that is true can remain hidden, we have to confront our personal garbage and finally do something about it. Only then can we move on. What appears to us as the negative energy of the symbol Pluto is nothing more than a mirror image of our own negativity staring back at us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part30.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part32.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
