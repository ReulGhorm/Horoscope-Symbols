Physical body, health, vitality. Traditionally associated with life expectancy through planets placed in the house and through the ruler of the rising sign<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The above traditional meanings all seem to work in chart interpretation, though as usual it is not readily apparent why this should be so.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first house is the area of the heavens occupied by the Sun during the two hours or so before sunrise. In terms of human biological cycles this period is the day’s low point. From this it should be obvious that the first house, although potent, cannot be quite so potent as tradition has made it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first house is the last house occupied by each body before it rises. Thus it represents energies that, while they still operate primarily in the personal hemisphere of the horoscope, also determine the relation of the personal area of life to the social. The first house is an interface: a boundary between two areas of existence that mediates how energies flow between the two. Therefore it corresponds to all interfaces that have to do with the transmission of energy from within the self to without.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the psychological level the interface is the personality, that is, the complex of psychological patterns that regulate the flow of energy from within oneself to the outer world. “Personality” is derived from <i>persona</i>, a Latin-Etruscan word for “mask.” The personality is the face we present to the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first house has much to do with individual self-expression, but it is also a house of relationship. The expression of self signified by the first house is always with respect to others. In first-house matters, one does not operate in a vacuum: one is the active person in relation to others. Serious planetary stresses in the first house will affect one’s intimate relationships just as severely as stresses in so-called “relationship” houses like the seventh and eleventh.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the physiological level, the interface represented by the first house is the body, especially the skin and physical appearance. Of course, according to tradition, many factors affect one’s appearance: not only planets in the first house, but also planets aspecting planets in the first, planets aspecting the Ascendant, and so forth. Simplistic correlations cannot be made between rising signs or rising planets and physical appearance, and one must also consider racial characteristics. The planet and sign symbolism of the first house is more likely to affect the <i>impression </i>one’s body makes on others, rather than just the way one looks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Health is also a first-house issue, in that the physical body is the medium through which we transmit our intentions, will, and desires into the world. Disease is not just discomfort, but also the inability to affect the world around one as vigorously as one would like. In sickness one is to varying degrees helpless and dependent on others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The body is also a receiver of energies from the world, and disease can be the result of not adapting to the outside world successfully. But this intake of energies belongs to the sixth house more than the first, which has to do with putting energies outward.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">On the psychological level the first house symbolizes the part of the self one chooses to mediate between oneself and the world. We create a face and then come to regard it as what we are. Thus the first house represents a self-image as much as an image presented to others. This is not so much a misrepresentation of ourselves as an incomplete expression.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark458">Relational Level </a><span class="p">Most traditional first-house significations are at the level of inner-outer interactions: personality, the physical appearance, oneself as opposed to someone else. The first house represents our sense of</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">being polarized with respect to someone or something in the environment. The first house is oneself as an active agent with regard to other people: at this level the house has no meaning apart from one’s relationship to others.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">On the level of things outside oneself this house signifies one’s own group as opposed to another group: We versus They. I am not referring to the overall ability of the individual to relate to groups; that is the domain of the eleventh. The first house signifies one’s own group only in relation to an external group. This facet of the first house is seen clearly in horary astrology, where in the matter of sports competitions the first house signifies “our team” as opposed to “their team.”</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the First House <span class="p">Planets in the first signify energies that become part of the individual’s expression of self with regard to others. A concentration of planets here is likely to increase an individual’s tendency toward subjectivity. Such people are likely to take the initiative in situations and may have difficulty in cooperating because so many of their planets are involved with putting energy out into the world rather than experiencing the energies of others. Being able to react to others as well as act is essential in cooperative relationships.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some planets in the first tend to lessen the degree of emphasis on the self. Neptune, for example, tends to cloud one’s awareness of how one projects energies toward others. Such an individual may gain the ability to project multiple personalities such that others never really know who the individual is. I do not mean split personalities, where the individual is not in control of the process, but rather people who invariably seem to be playing a part.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">With Saturn in the first, one can be so concerned with responsibility and external demands that it is difficult to place oneself ahead of others. A strong notion of propriety or right and wrong tends to dominate one’s energy projections into the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part111.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part113.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
