It is the basic energy of Being. Just as the physical Sun shines and enables all the other bodies to shine by reflecting its light, so the symbolic astrological Sun is the basic energy of which all the other planetary energies are specialized reflections.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Sun represents light, consciousness, and day. It is the ultimate planetary symbol of yang, yang being the active energizing principle that is the source of all motion. The Sun, as yang, is the polar counterpart to the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moon, as yin. The Sun and Moon are one of the horoscope’s most important manifestations of this primary duality.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">As yang, the Sun is the archetype of will, power, and desire, but not necessarily sexual desire. It has the meaning of “wanting to.” It represents the energy that exerts itself upon and influences whatever may exist. The energy of the Sun does not simply accept, but always seeks to change, and, if possible, to improve. Above all, it seeks room for the greater expression of itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The Sun is also the energy that gives an entity its integrity as a being. It represents the entity’s will to exist. As such, it counters pressure from the environment that seeks either to make the entity something that it is not, or to destroy it completely.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The Sun is the archetype of the hero. The hero sets out into the world and attempts to bring order out of chaos through imposing his will. He undergoes severe trials in order to prove his strength and worthiness, especially against the powers of darkness. At sunset the hero, like the Sun, descends into the underworld and is challenged by the monsters of darkness. After proving his right to be born again the following dawn, he manifests triumphant in the world.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">This is not just poetry. The pattern described here can be seen in the personality of someone with a strongly placed Sun. (The idea of strong versus weak placements is dealt with at the beginning of </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a>12<span style=" color: #000;">.) These people have great vitality, are tireless both emotionally and physically, and work relentlessly to bring into the world their vision of what ought to be. But their efforts are not wholly selfless. They always have a personal dimension. Solar people work to express who they are and seek to make an impact in terms of their own identity. Consequently, they are at the forefront of any activity where they can be recognized. They do not work behind the scenes. Solar-dominant personalities are able to make others notice them: simply by their demeanor, they turn heads when they enter a room. They are also people who seem to be at the center of a number of other people’s lives. Like the Sun, they provide light and energy so that others can live and act. But the solar type needs always to be acknowledged by others for having done this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">For these reasons, the Sun has traditionally been said to “rule” persons in authority, like employers, important government officials, the government itself, and, of course, kings and nobles. But keep in mind that planets do not symbolize actual persons or things. The relationship exists only insofar as an actual person manifests the energies of the Sun. Not all kings or presidents act in a solar manner.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is a negative side to all this. Solar people are not especially modest. They may even be boastful and arrogant, totally wrapped up in themselves. Sometimes they may overestimate their own worth, not feeling it necessary to do anything to justify their high self-opinion. However, in truth this is not really in the character of the Sun, which is an active force concerned with accomplishment. When a solar personality exhibits this kind of problem, there is usually something else wrong.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is often difficult to get solar types to cooperate with others in a team effort. They often feel that they have to be at the forefront or they would rather have nothing to do with the project. There is also the solar type who would rather do nothing than risk compromising his or her integrity. A strong solar type who has indications elsewhere of severe ego weakness is the most likely to have this kind of problem.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the psychological level, the Sun represents the Jungian libido: that is, the basic psychic energy that drives all psychological functions. Like the libido, the Sun often acts non-specifically, simply providing the energy for which another symbol will provide a specific shape. In predictive astrology, the action of the Sun is usually simply to set off or to time an event or development in the individual’s life. It brings energy to whatever symbol complex represents the event. Symbolism that is specific to the Sun is often absent in such cases.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Sun is also physical energy, and if it is weakened through contact with a symbol that denies energy, there will be a decline in the individual’s physical energy level. This is most marked with Sun-Neptune contacts. Difficulties with solar energy in the chart can indicate periods of physical illness. Many astrologers even consider the Sun to represent the physical body. Here again, we have the planet-as-thing fallacy, but the Sun certainly can be an index to physical vitality.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Archetypally speaking, masculinity is an aspect of yang. Therefore, the Sun, along with Mars, represents masculinity. Traditionally, the Sun was considered as having to do with persons of the male sex, but again this is using a planet to represent an entity. Now that sex roles are shifting, a growing number of women exhibit solar personalities, and thereby serve as representatives of solar energy in the lives of others. If one were to have a female employer, for example, her role would be as solar as if she were male. And, of course, a male who is not very yang in temperament will not manifest strong solar symbolism despite his sex. The archetypal sexuality that an individual will manifest is only partly connected with a person’s gender. Most people are mixtures of the two energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, it is still observable that women as a group have a</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">greater tendency than men to experience their solar energies as coming through males. In fact, a common difficulty with women is being cut off from the masculine elements in their own nature. They project it onto their men, thereby depriving themselves of initiative and independence. (And men often do a corresponding thing with their lunar energies.) In most cases, difficulties that women consistently have with men are best handled by getting the women in touch with the masculine side of their own personality rather than by doing anything about a particular relationship that they may have with a man. The trend is clearly toward women gaining their inward masculinity consciously for themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark82">One classic male function that is associated with the Sun is fatherhood. The Sun shares this function with Saturn, but the two represent very different facets. The situation of the Sun in the birthchart often relates to the individual’s experience of the father—not necessarily the actual father, but all the people who played that role. Often the mother will actually play the father role, in which case it is that relationship which will be symbolized by the Sun. A key concept is that the Sun represents the experience of being fathered, not the objective truth about one’s father. In fact, the relationship with all authority figures will be shown by the Sun. As a component of the father archetype, the Sun represents the father’s function as a shaper of the will, particularly the will to be a free, independent source of power and energy in one’s own right.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">From what has been said, it should be clear that a weakly placed Sun in a horoscope signifies weak vitality, and in some way an inability to fend for oneself. On the psychological side it may indicate an individual who is too subject to another’s will, or who cannot defend and protect what he or she values, at least through direct confrontation. On the physical side, a weak Sun can indicate bodily weakness, a tendency to illnesses and allergies, or simply a lack of muscle strength. A full understanding of the Sun in a horoscope is an important step toward understanding the person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part21.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part23.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
