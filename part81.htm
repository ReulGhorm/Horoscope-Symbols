Polarity is partly the result of the changing of the elements (fire and air are positive, earth and water negative). But I believe that polarity also has an independent signification in its own right.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Not all signs are equally positive or equally negative: some are more so than others. In general, fire signs are the most yang, and water signs the most yin, with air and earth signs in between.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is safe to say on the basis of astrological experience that the positive signs are usually more objectively oriented and more outgoing, assertive, and interested in what is going on around them. The negative signs are more likely to be inwardly directed and concerned with subjective experience. The main issue is not passivity: some positive signs are actually more passive than some negative signs. For example, the negative signs Capricorn and Scorpio are not especially passive, while Libra, a positive sign, is often so. The key to being positive or negative is whether one’s attention and energies are focused primarily on external or on internal affairs and experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark338">Clearly, sign polarity is one of the factors that must be checked when determining whether an individual is primarily introverted or extra verted.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part80.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part82.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
