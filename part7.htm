Most people feel that they end at their skins and that everything outside belongs to a world that is other than themselves. This basic division of the universe into self and not-self is important in understanding the individual world-view and the ways most people structure their experience. But if you are studying astrology it is not an adequate understanding of the structure of existence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I do not wish you to accept what I am about to say blindly on faith, nor do I want you to reject it out of hand. I want you to try it as a working</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hypothesis and see whether it makes sense for you and improves your understanding of life. After you have done much study of astrology you may or may not agree with what I am about to say, but the very act of suspending your current belief system about what you are and what constitutes an individual will enable you to come to a much higher level of realization than you may have had before. Instead of simply providing a new way of playing old ego games, your study of astrology will have expanded your understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Here are the basic ideas I ask you to entertain as working hypotheses. You are, as an individual, the sum total of all your actions, all your experiences, and everything and everyone that is in your life. There is no split between the self and the not-self. As will be explained on pages 263-266, whatever split you may feel changes location within your field of consciousness according to where your attention has turned and what kinds of issues you are dealing with. In other words, the apparent split that you feel is only relative, not absolute.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Equally important is a second principle: you are, in the totality of what you are, the creator and focus for divine energy within your universe. This is not to say that there is no God higher than you as an individual. More accurately, you are the channel for that entity’s energy coming into your world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Before challenging this, you should recognize that you do not experience the universe as it is in the ultimate sense, but as it is channeled through your senses and modified by the sum total of your previous conceptions and past experiences. What you create, therefore, is really your experience of the universe, and your experience is yours and uniquely yours. Now comes a point even harder to accept: you create not only the experiences of events involving you with others, but also the experiences of events involving others with others. If such experiences were not appropriate to you at the time when you experienced them, you would not be in the place that allows you to experience them. Events of which you are unaware may or may not exist on the level of absolute reality, but unless you are aware of such events, they are not real for you and do not exist for you. If you have trouble with this idea, remember it is only a working hypothesis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Even I have trouble applying it consistently.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Before you can deal with the idea that you create events, there is something else to understand. To say you create something, let us say something “evil,” is not to say you are guilty of it. You must look at events and things without making value judgments, either positive or negative. You are only concerned with what is so in your life, not what ought to be. Most</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">people in their normal consciousness of life are not ready to make judgments about what ought to be.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Here is where the horoscope is useful. We have said you are the creator of your own experience and the true source of all intentions in your universe. For one reason or another, however, you will often mislay within consciousness some fact or truth about your universe, and get into the habit of no longer seeing it. This is usually because recognizing such a truth will bring you into conflict with some other aspect of your universe: events that you experience or participate in, or desires and intentions that have taken hold of your awareness. Or you may have created such a conflict in the past, and now you have fallen out of the habit of dealing with issues related to that conflict. In these ways you can get lost in your own universe and need some kind of map or compass. All systems of divination, including astrology, really have the same purpose: to find where one is within one’s own universe. One can then get back in touch with the creative process of making one’s universe work. None of these techniques, be it palmistry, Tarot, numerology, astrology, or any other, should be used for telling what is going to happen to people as if they were only passive spectators in a universe beyond their control. If one forecasts events, one should make it clear that they will only result from energies that the individual is currently manifesting, should these energies go on to their logical conclusion without change.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This brings us to another point, which to rationalists and materialists may seem like a dodge. Astrology and all other divinatory techniques require the active participation of the person being counseled, so that both client and counselor can apply the symbols of astrology or whatever system is being used to the individuals own life. A good astrologer can get something out of the chart without the client’s active participation, but it is not really useful to do so. Far too many people go to an astrologer expecting to sit back passively and be told something about themselves. Usually the astrologer can amaze and astound with facts and insights, but the client then receives no benefit from the process except entertainment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Totally apart from whether any real influences come from the planets, an individual can gain simply by focusing on astrological symbols. Just as by making up stories suggested by inkblots one can reveal to oneself aspects of life that are not otherwise apparent, one can also gain insight by studying one’s horoscope. There is evidence that there is considerably more going on with astrology than with an inkblot test, but I am willing to admit there may be certain parts of astrology that function entirely in such a way. Unlike the Rorschach test, however, in which the same inkblots are shown</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to every individual, horoscopes are peculiar to each person. For whatever reason (and several have been suggested, including Jung’s concept of synchronicity), the horoscope seems to act as a schematic diagram of one’s intentions in life. It only shows what one is going to experience because one intends to experience it. It is a description not of what is going to happen (that is, destiny), but of what one is and what shape one is going to give to one’s life. Though many critics have said so and many astrologers have made it seem that way, astrology is in no way a retreat from individual responsibility. Rather, it acknowledges responsibility on the highest level.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21">In everything said so far, the following is implicit: if you are in touch with whatever you are doing and know your responsibility for what is happening (and are therefore operating from a position of choice), you are going to be happier and more fulfilled than if you feel out of touch (and therefore constantly a victim of forces beyond your control). You will always </a><i>be </i>what you are in the deepest sense of that idea, but you may not be <i>aware </i>of what you are and of what should be done in life as a result. The aim is not to change yourself, but to make yourself more conscious of what you are at a particular point in time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part6.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part8.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
