Consequently, they organized a zodiac composed of twelve equal segments into several sequences of energies repeating several times within the signs such that every sign is related to every other sign in an orderly, geometrical way. To a considerable extent the qualities of each sign arise from its being a unique combination of the components of these sequences. Therefore a thorough comprehension of these principles will make the inner meanings of the signs more apparent.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Four sequences concern us here. The first is the four elements, or triplicities, so called because each element is given to three signs. Starting with Aries, the elemental sequence is fire, earth, air, and water, three complete times in the zodiac. Thus the fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; the earth signs Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; the air signs Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius; and the water signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The second sequence is the three crosses or quadruplicities, so called because each is given to four signs which form a cross in the zodiac. Starting with Aries again, the cross sequence is cardinal, fixed, and mutable. The cardinal cross is composed of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn; the fixed cross of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius; and the mutable cross of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark319">The third sequence is that of polarity. Starting with Aries again, the sequence is positive and negative, alternating six times in the twelvefold zodiac. The positive signs are the fire and air signs Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. The negative signs are the earth and water signs Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fourth sequence is that of individual signs (the first half of the zodiac from Aries through Virgo) versus social signs (the second half of the zodiac from Libra through Pisces). This is not one of the ancient classifications of the signs but it is worth discussing in this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part77.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part79.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
