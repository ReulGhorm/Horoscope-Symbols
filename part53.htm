Consequently, there are also two direct midpoints for any two bodies, one bisecting the shorter arc (which we shall call the nearer midpoint), the other the longer arc (which we shall call the farther midpoint). This is why we say direct midpoint combinations can be made by opposition as well as conjunction aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The nearer and farther midpoints are always exactly opposite each other. They form an axis going from one side of the zodiac to a point exactly 180° away on the other side, much like the axes formed by the Moon’s nodes, the Ascendant-Descendant, and the Midheaven-Imum Coeli. Therefore a body that is opposite the nearer midpoint will always be conjunct the farther midpoint, and vice versa. Experience shows that in natal charts there is little or no distinction between the nearer and farther midpoints. Thus we can say that for all practical purposes an opposition to a midpoint is the same as a conjunction to a midpoint. (This is not always true, however, as in the composite horoscope there does seem to be a difference in intensity, if not meaning. See my book <i>Planets in Composite</i>.) By the same token, if a body is sextile one end of a midpoint axis it is trine the other end, and vice versa. A similar relationship exists between the semisquare and sesquiquadrate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part52.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part54.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
