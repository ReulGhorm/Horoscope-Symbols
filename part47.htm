But harmonic syndromes also add some features of their own.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">First- and Second-Harmonic Syndromes: Multiple Conjunctions and Oppositions <span class="p">A conjunction becomes a first-harmonic syndrome when several planets are closely conjoined at the same spot in the zodiac. And a second-harmonic syndrome occurs when several planets are conjoined at one or both ends of an opposition.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Even as a single conjunction ties two planetary energies together in such a way that a person finds it hard to distinguish between them, a multiple conjunction does this for several planetary energies, with the result that the person can have a predominantly subjective viewpoint with little ability to understand positions other than his own. On the plus side, this may mean a concentration of energies that in the right circumstances can be extraordinarily effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A simple opposition is an unalloyed second harmonic, but in order for there to be a second-harmonic syndrome, there must be some conjunctions as well as oppositions. Thus, while the second harmonic sets the tone of the syndrome, bringing in the opposition’s sense of polarity and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conflict, this is modified by the conjunction’s lack of perspective and its concentration of energies.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark229">Third-Harmonic Syndromes: Grand Trines </a><span class="p">Astrologers have long debated whether the grand trine is easy or difficult to deal with. The consensus is that it is a trine in overdose. Many feel it makes energies flow so easily that the individual does not get enough of the kind of growth that can come only through confronting adversity. Being a symbol of perfect equilibrium and balance, the trine represents absolutely no power for change.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 600pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="351" height="800" alt="image" src="Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 14. First- and second-harmonic syndromes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: left;">But I find the matter to be not so simple. In his heliocentric work on geomagnetic storms, John Nelson has noted that when two planets in a grand</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">trine are inner planets (planets from Mars inward toward the Sun), the grand trine acts like a hard aspect, disrupting short-wave radio transmissions. But when two are outer planets (from Jupiter outward) and only the third is an inner planet, the effect is like a super trine in that it calms down the conditions for radio transmission to an unusual degree. The same effect may be working in the geocentric astrology of individuals, but we do not yet know for sure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 362pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="479" height="482" alt="image" src="Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 15. A third-harmonic syndrome</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31">Another important effect I have noted relates to the precision of the angles involved. If none of the three trines is more than 1° from exact, the grand trine appears to have much more energy than otherwise. This seems to result from the action of midpoints (which are discussed fully in </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapters </a>8 <a href="part62.htm#bookmark268" class="s31">and </a>9<span style=" color: #000;">). In an exact grand trine, the midpoint of each pair of planets lies exactly opposite the third factor. This makes the grand trine a series of three oppositions and gives it a more dynamic character than it would otherwise have. Even when the grand trine is not exact, as long as one pair of planets</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">has its midpoint lying opposite the third planet, there is something of this dynamic quality. This does not work unless the orb of the midpoint configuration is kept small. I do not consider midpoints beyond 1° to either side of an exact opposition, though others use orbs of 1.5° to 2°.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark230">Grand trines that are somewhat out of orb I find to be more static and more likely to produce difficulties arising from the individual’s extreme passivity or inactivity. Very close grand trines, on the other hand, will have something of the same energy as grand sextiles (see below). This means that there will be plenty of energy for any activity related to the symbolism of the planets involved, and the energy will flow smoothly. While it may seem to others that luck simply falls into a person’s lap with these configurations, it is more accurate to say that the person knows what to do with the apparent luck and has in fact done a great deal to bring it about. It is simply that not much visible effort is involved.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 225pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 16. Fourth-harmonic syndromes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fourth-Harmonic Syndromes: Grand Crosses and T-Squares <span class="p">As mentioned above, a grand cross or grand square is a complete fourth- harmonic syndrome with all possible points filled by planets, whereas a T- square is a grand cross with one arm missing. Both configurations are often called very stressful. It is more accurate to say that they are high-energy aspects like all squares and oppositions, and they require some care in handling. With a grand cross or T-square, one needs to focus one’s considerable energies and use them for specific purposes. If one lets the energies take control, they can result in unfortunate events, what kind</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">depending on the nature of the symbolism. Usually they are events over which one feels one has no control. Suppressing the energies and the behavioral manifestations that arise out of them can also produce unpleasant events.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark231">From the attitudes of many toward these two configurations, one would almost expect to see them routinely in the charts of mass murderers and the like. They occur in such charts, of course, but not that frequently. Hitler’s chart, for example, has a notable lack of such aspects. (Instead, it has a tenth-harmonic syndrome, about which more below.)</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most astrologers find that the T-square with its missing arm is more unbalanced and difficult to deal with than the grand cross. Many have stated that this causes the individual to focus on the issue relating to the house where the missing arm of the cross would have fallen. I am not at all sure this kind of difference exists, though the idea is elegant.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Certainly, both the grand cross and the T-square are common and are found in the charts of many perfectly normal people. On meeting them, however, you will find an intensity lacking in others. It is as if there is tremendous energy lurking just below the surface and waiting to be released. Eventually it usually is, in ways that are constructive. Much, of course, depends on the planets involved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 227pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="303" alt="image" src="Image_035.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 17. Fifth- and tenth-harmonic syndromes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Fifth- and Tenth-Harmonic Syndromes: Grand Quintiles and Strings of Quintiles and Deciles <span class="p">I have never seen a perfect grand quintile, a pattern in which five planets are ranged around the zodiac at 72°</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">intervals. I have only seen less complete fifth-and tenth-harmonic syndromes in which several planets are involved, but they do not complete a regular polygon in the zodiac.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark232">In these cases there seems to have been something fateful and portentous about the life. Even if there was nothing terribly significant about the person, it always seemed as if the person would use tremendous amounts of energy to achieve an objective. There is a capacity for ruthlessness with these syndromes, but also a capacity for great achievement. At opposite poles are Hitler and Einstein, both of whom have strong tenth-harmonic syndromes, and who have both been fateful figures in history.</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Sixth-Harmonic Syndromes: Grand Sextiles, Kites, Mystic Rectangles, and Minor Grand Trines <span class="p">Grand sextiles, like grand quintiles, are rare: I have seen only one. But other kinds of sixth-harmonic syndrome are more common. One type, called a “kite,” has a close grand trine, with one of the three planets closely opposed by a fourth planet that also lies on the midpoint of the other two in the grand trine. Another type, called a “mystic rectangle” by Michael Erlewine of Michigan, is composed of two pairs of oppositions that are exactly sextile and trine each other. Yet another type, the “minor grand trine,” consists of a trine bisected by a sextile.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The most important consideration with any of these is whether or not it includes an opposition to give it energy. Any sextile syndrome that includes more than two sextiles must also include an opposition, because an opposition is three sextiles.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">An opposition is impossible in the minor grand trine, but here a planet is conjunct the midpoint of two other planets. This adds some energy to the configuration, but in most cases an opposition makes a sextile syndrome much more dynamic and energy-laden. The effect of the exact minor grand trine is like the effect of the exact grand trine. That is, the energy flows smoothly and at great speed, but there can be problems if one does not try to break out of the behavioral ruts that one can fall into with third and sixth harmonics.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A kite contains only one opposition. A person I knew with a kite pattern exhibited all the characteristics of someone caught in a trinal trap. That is, he had a strongly defined behavior pattern without the energy to break out of it. I suspect that the more oppositions there are in a sextile pattern, the more energy there is to prevent rigid patterns from forming, and the easier it is to break out of any existing ones.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The only grand-sextile person I have ever known is not obviously extraordinary, except that she derives no great pleasure from the good things</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in life falling into her lap. She feels no satisfaction unless she has earned them. This is characteristic of someone with strong hard-aspect patterns: remember that a grand sextile has six oppositions as well as six sextiles. But the sextile-trine pattern is there in that she often finds it difficult to get herself moving even when she knows intellectually that she must.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Twelfth-Harmonic Syndromes: Yods <span class="p">I am skipping syndromes of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleventh harmonics, as there is little to say about them that has not already been covered in the discussions of aspect families and of harmonic syndromes in general. I include the twelfth- harmonic syndrome here because one of its forms, the yod, finger of God, or finger of fate, is a commonly mentioned aspect pattern.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 563pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="750" alt="image" src="Image_036.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 18.

The planet at the tip of the “finger” is in clockwise and counterclockwise quincunxes to the two other planets, and these two other planets are in sextile to each other. As its other names suggest, the yod has often been considered an aspect of fatality, by which I suppose is meant that the three planets are likely to indicate an underlying theme in one’s life, constant and relatively unchanging. This is consistent with what we already know about the quincunx. But what changes do introducing the sextile make in the overall symbolism? In my opinion, not many. A sextile, being two-twelfths of the circle, does not much mitigate the twelfth-harmonic nature of the combination.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="s31" name="bookmark234">Nevertheless, the two planets in sextile to each other do have their midpoint directly on the third planet. This does make a difference, assuming that the orbs are smaller than 1° to 1.5°. The direct midpoint configuration (see </a><a href="part48.htm#bookmark236" class="a">Chapter </a>8<span style=" color: #000;">) gives the yod a dynamic quality ordinarily lacking in three- series aspects. This means that even though the yod has the static, passive quality of the three-series, it can also signify crises in which the energies</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">have to be faced directly and specific courses of action taken in order for the energies to work out positively. Thus the yod contains the germ of its own resolution in a way that simple quincunxes do not. If the orb of a yod exceeds that of allowable midpoint combinations, however, this quality of the yod is lost.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="161" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_038.png"/></span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark235"><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12pt;">*</span></a>John Addey, <i>Harmonics in Astrology </i>(Green Bay, Wisconsin: The Cambridge Circle, 1976), pages 62-65.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part46.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part48.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
