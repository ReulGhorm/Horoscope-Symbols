And yet, as in all positive-negative pairs, the later sign is a fulfillment and completion of the earlier. Virgo represents the completed individual, not as in Leo standing alone and glorying in itself, but rather confronting both the physical and social universes and trying to come to terms with them. Virgo approaches the physical universe as an obstacle to which one must adapt, a framework through which one can learn to be effective, and a reality that must be served. It approaches the social universe in the same way. From the arrogance of the negative Leo we move to the submissiveness of the negative Virgo. From trying to be self-sufficient in Leo we try to be totally efficient in Virgo. Virgo justifies its existence by how effective it is in getting along in the world and making the best of it. The emphasis on total individuality is gone.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Virgo type needs little social recognition for the quality of its workmanship: its sense of achievement is based on knowing it has done the job well. In confronting the reality of the external physical and social universes, Virgo has at least to some extent become cautious and maybe a little fearful in the face of that with which it has to deal. It is almost as if Virgo is the result of the childishly exuberant egotism of Leo encountering its first severe defeat. It is chastened and careful. And even though the Virgo type does not need others to affirm the quality of whatever work it does, it is not quite sure of itself as an individual and it is therefore not very resistant to external pressure. With respect to behavior, Virgo under social pressure can be one of the most conformist signs of the zodiac. It does not need to be treated like royalty, but it does need to be accepted by others for itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I do not mean that all Virgos are timid, lacking in confidence, or conformist. I am merely trying to place Virgo in the scheme of the developing personality that the zodiac describes. Virgo is the individualism of Leo sobered by the encounter with external necessities and duties. Any actual Virgo personality is as capable as any other sign of being strong and successful. Virgo affects the <i>manner </i>in which one becomes successful, not the fact of success.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo does not depend on abundant self-confidence to get ahead, nor would it ever try to bluff others into making them think it is more than it is.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo attempts to be realistic about self-evaluation. If anything, it will err on the side of humility. It is as honest as Leo and as unwilling to compromise itself by misrepresentation. Virgo attempts to achieve by mastering the tools that the world offers it, by creating an orderly, dependable relationship with the world around it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo may be chastened by its confrontation with the physical universe, but it is not crushed. In fact, it strives to achieve what some Leos think they already possess: perfection. Self-criticism and self-analysis are the keys to perfection, and Virgo may be merciless in judging itself when it fails (and also sometimes merciless when others fail).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark375">Here we have the key to Virgo as a mutable sign. Unlike Taurus, which for the most part deals with the world as it is, Virgo attempts to change itself, and eventually the world. Virgos may not enjoy being out in the open in what they do, but success in effecting changes is important to them.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">While it does not insist on being boss, Virgo needs to feel effective. Yet the physical world is not an entirely reliable place: things go wrong even with the best of plans. This bothers Virgo more than most signs. Thus in an effort to achieve control by letting nothing escape its notice it tends to concentrate on details. This makes the sign good at analysis but less good at getting the grand overview. The details may overwhelm the large viewpoint.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The concern for order may also cause Virgo to become extremely neat in personal habits, but if Virgo cannot achieve perfect order, it may give up completely. In fact, the extremely high standards that Virgo holds in many areas of its life may cause it to give up completely when it fails to live up to them. Otherwise, the sign is moderate in most regards.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo has high aesthetic standards. It is the sign of crafts, in which function is united with form, such that each completes the other and neither takes from the other. But Virgo is not especially patient with beauty that has no function; always a practical sign, it believes that some purpose should be served by everything.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Virgo to Mercury and the Asteroids <span class="p">Mercury is the traditional ruler of Virgo, but modem astrologers are feeling increasingly uneasy about this assignment. In my opinion, Virgo and Mercury make one of the worst sign-ruler fits of all. Mercury is airy while Virgo is earthy. Mercury loves abstraction while Virgo is practical. It is true that both have a mutable quality, and that Virgo does have strong intellectual concerns, but Virgo’s are largely for the sake of being effective, while Mercury’s are for their own sake. The game-playing aspect of</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mercury is missing in Virgo; Virgo is very serious. Mercury has no special concern with duty, while Virgo does.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The astrologer Eleanor Bach has suggested that the four major asteroids rule Virgo. This is a tempting idea because the woman holding the sheaf of wheat who is pictured in the constellation Virgo is in fact the goddess Ceres, which is also the name of one of the four major asteroids. And the astrological effects of Vesta, which are the most clearly observable of the four asteroids, are extremely Virgoan. Both Vesta and Virgo are strongly concerned with duty and responsibility, especially the duties of home and hearth. Both have strong connections with work and with being efficient. Neither symbol has an easy time with play: Vesta is much like Saturn in its reserved and serious attitudes. And of course, Vesta is a virgin goddess.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark376">Assigning the other two major asteroids, Pallas and Juno, to Virgo is less obvious. Zipporah Dobyns, who has done extensive work with asteroids, gives these to Libra along with Venus for reasons mentioned in the section on Libra. But Pallas has a quality of critical, fighting intellectualism that seems more Virgoan than Libran to me. And Juno, at least in her capacity as goddess of domestic crafts and household responsibilities, also seems Virgoan.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I am inclined to give all four major asteroids to Virgo, although a case can be made for assigning Ceres to Taurus or Cancer insofar as the goddess is an earth-mother symbol as both Bach and Dobyns seem to feel. Clearly, with all the new planets and asteroids discovered since ancient times, the once-neat order of rulerships has been badly disturbed.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Virgo on Planets <span class="p">The principal effect of Virgo on planets is to make them work with extra precision and care. Planets with exuberant and explosive energies (like Mars and Uranus) do not get along as well in Virgo as those (like Saturn) whose nature is steady and cautious. Whether or not Mercury rules Virgo, it is favorably placed there. Venus does not seem to do well in Virgo from a sexual point of view, because Virgo, as its name suggests, tends to be sexually modest. But Venus in Virgo is more successful with regard to creativity, especially of the craftsmanly kind.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because it is interested in dealing efficiently with the physical universe, Virgo can be changeable when it perceives new contingencies that have to be met. Also, its lack of self-confidence can cause it to change according to the pressures to which it is subjected. Therefore a large number of planets in Virgo will tend to increase the mutability of the horoscope as well as its level of earthiness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part91.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part93.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
