Their most important use is with respect to the planets and other points such as the Ascendant, Midheaven, and midpoints. Aspects among these symbols link energies to energies, and to areas for energies to manifest, enabling the symbols to operate in pairs or even groups. But aspects do not merely link planetary energies and other points: they link them in ways that are peculiar to the number of degrees involved in the aspect. For example, points joined by a 90° angle do not interact the same as when joined by a 120° angle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All the angles used as aspects are derived by dividing the 360° circle by small whole numbers. Thus, 360°/1 = 360° (conjunction), 360°/2</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">= /180° (opposition), 360°/3 = 120° (trine), 360°/4 = 90° (square), and so forth. A progression such as this is called a harmonic series, the general form of which is as follows: <i>N</i>/1, <i>N</i>/2, <i>N</i>/3, <i>N</i>/4, <i>N</i>/5,…<i>N/I</i>, <i>N</i>/(<i>I</i>+1),…, where <i>I </i>is a series of integers or whole numbers from one to infinity. <i>N </i>can have any value, but in astrology it is usually 360°.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the past, astrology has only used angles derived from division of the circle by one, two, three, four, and six. These are the aspects used by the Greeks: the conjunction, opposition, trine, square, and sextile. They are often referred to as the “classical” or “Ptolemaic” aspects, after Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century <span class="s32">A.D.</span>), the most influential Greek authority on astrology and astronomy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark177">In the Renaissance, astrologers perceived that the harmonic series is the basis of the aspects, and began experimenting with dividing the circle by five, seven, eight, and twelve. Dividing the circle by five yields the quintile (360°/5 = 72°) and the biquintile (2 × 360°/5 = 144°). Seven yields the septile (360°/7 = 51 °25’42.9”), the biseptile (2 × 360°/7 = 102°51’25.7”), and the triseptile (3 × 360°/7 = 154°17’08.6”). Division by eight yields the semisquare or octile (360°/8 = 45°) and the sesquiquadrate or trioctile (3 ×</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">360°/8 = 135°). Division by nine, ten, and eleven were omitted, but division by twelve was introduced, because twelve is the basis of the signs of the zodiac. This gave us the semisextile (360°/12 = 30°) and the quincunx (5 × 360°/12 = 150°).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Among the astrologers who were active in this expansion of the Greek theory of aspects were Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), known for his contributions to astronomy, and Morinus (1583–1656), the last of the great French astrologers of the Renaissanace. But division by seven never caught on well, and division by five fared little better. It is only in modern times that astrologers are beginning to look at these seriously, along with a number of other divisions.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark178" class="s31">In our own century, John Addey and his followers have been the most responsible for reintroducing the idea of aspects as harmonics and for reviving interest in dividing the circle by five, seven, and other numbers. Their research has pointed to a link between aspect symbolism and number symbolism, the idea being that aspect symbolism originates in the number by which the circle is divided. The number symbolism employed is that of the ancient Pythagoreans and the medieval Kabbalists, not of modern numerology. </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark178" class="a">Table </a>1 <span style=" color: #000;">summarizes number meanings derived from Addey’s writings and my own work.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 37pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark178">Table 1 Number Symbolism</a></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -50pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">One: <span class="p">Complete union, without the faculty of self- reflection.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: -49pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Two: <span class="p">Polarity, complementarity, and conflict; also consciousness, which arises from self-reflection.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three: <span class="p">Balance, equilibrium, stability.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Four: <span class="p">Resistance, matter.

Multiplying a number by three, five, seven, etc., changes the symbolism of the original number even more than does multiplying by two. See page 154.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark179">Interpreting aspects as harmonics suggests that astrological phenomena may be linked to the waves studied by physicists. Cycles of the planets are mathematically identical to waves of light, sound, the ocean, or a pendulum, which differ from astrological cycles mainly in that they are faster. In nature, whenever a wave effect occurs, it is accompanied by other waves that are half as long, one-third as long, one-fourth as long, and so forth. These are harmonics of the original, principal wave. If we look at the cycles of the planets, we find the cycles of position that every pair of planets goes through from conjunction to conjunction. Roughly half-way in time between conjunctions, the two planets are in opposition; one-third of the way, they are in trine; one-fourth of the way, they are in square; and so forth. This suggests that there is some kind of relation between waves and their harmonics on the one hand and planetary cycles and their aspects on the other. The results of this study may bring astrology directly in line with studies of other natural phenomena.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part38.htm">Families of Aspects</a><a class="toc0" href="part39.htm">Orbs of Aspects</a><a class="toc0" href="part40.htm">Parallels and Contraparallels</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part36.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part38.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
