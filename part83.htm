A planet in the sign it rules is said to be “in dignity,” or “in honor,” meaning favorably placed; modern astrologers often say that such a planet works well because it is in a sign with which it has some qualities in common. When a planet is in the sign opposite the one it rules, it is in its “detriment,” where it is said to work badly.</a></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part83.htm#bookmark342" class="s31">A planet is also in dignity in another sign, its “exaltation,” where it is supposed to work especially well.

While almost all astrologers agree on the rulerships that have been assigned to the more newly discovered planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, there is less</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">agreement on the exaltations and falls of these planets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark342">Table 7</a></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Planetary Dignities and Debilities</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 72pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="537" height="96" alt="image" src="Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*Modern exaltations and fals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Rulerships and Detriments <span class="p">The true origin of rulerships and detriments is probably lost forever, but we do have a simple and elegant explanation of them from Ptolemy. Unfortunately, the perfect symmetry of his schema was upset by the discovery of the planets beyond Saturn.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ptolemy started out with the two signs Cancer and Leo, because these are where the Sun is in its northernmost passage, in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, when there is the greatest heat. He assigned the Moon to Cancer because Cancer is feminine, and the Sun to Leo because Leo is masculine. Then he took the opposite signs, Capricorn and Aquarius, and assigned them to Saturn, because the Sun’s passage through these signs marks the coldest time of the year, and Saturn, the farthest visible planet from the Sun, is to astrologers cold in nature. Then he assigned Sagittarius and Pisces, the next signs on either side of Capricorn and Aquarius, to Jupiter, the next planet in toward the Sun. The next pair of signs, Scorpio and Aries, were given to Mars; the next pair, Libra and Taurus, to Venus; and the last pair, Gemini and Virgo, to Mercury, which has the closest orbit to the Sun.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark343">In effect, Ptolemy was putting the planets in the order of the distance of their orbits from the Sun, though he, of course, believed the planets orbit the Earth. He was merely observing the length of time it takes the planets to go once around the zodiac (the farther out from the Sun they are, the longer it takes). In the case of Venus and Mercury, which from Earth both appear to take about a year, he was observing that Venus never appears farther than 46° from the Sun, and Mercury never appears farther from the Sun than 28°.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although Ptolemy discussed the similarities of the signs and their ruling planets to some extent, it is clear from his discussion that similarity of symbolism was not the main concern. The main concern was the neat</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">schema.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All went well for about 1,700 years, until Uranus was discovered in the late eighteenth century. This completely upset the schema of rulerships as described by Ptolemy, and beginning at that time there was a change in the principle governing rulerships. Whereas before, the schema was the basis for assigning planets to signs, now the basis became the similarity between the signs and their respective ruling planets. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me (see the article on Aquarius in the next chapter), Uranus was assigned to Aquarius, sometimes as a joint ruler with Saturn, and sometimes displacing Saturn altogether. Then when Neptune was discovered, it was assigned to Pisces. When Pluto was found, those more interested in a schema thought that the progression should continue and wanted to give Pluto to Aries. But a greater number have felt that the symbolism of Pluto is more Scorpionic than Arian. I am inclined to agree.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is also another reason for assigning Pluto to Scorpio—a reason I have not seen discussed elsewhere. The outer planets have more to do with transpersonal, collective energies, much in the way of the second six signs from Libra to Pisces. Thus I find it hard to relate Pluto to a sign that represents such a basic, primitive, individual function as Aries. Scorpio, on the other hand, is in the collective half of the zodiac and makes a better candidate on those grounds as well as on the grounds of symbolism.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The schema of rulerships has been further complicated by additional bodies, particularly the asteroids Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. These have been either all assigned to Virgo, or Ceres and Vesta have been given to Virgo and Pallas and Juno to Libra. I believe that assigning the asteroids to this part of the zodiac is consistent, since the location of the orbits of these bodies between Mars and Jupiter would logically place them on the boundary of the first and second halves of the zodiac.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Clearly, the Ptolemaic criteria for establishing sign rulership are in chaos and cannot be maintained. And with the addition of the asteroids and planetoids such as the recently discovered Chiron it is likely that we will eventually have more bodies than signs. This creates a serious problem for the traditional idea of sign rulership, although not for every part of it.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark344">Exaltations and Falls </a><span class="p">The lore of exaltations and falls emerges full-blown in Ptolemy, and beyond this, their origin is obscure. There seems little logic to support exaltations and falls. Sometimes there is clearly an affinity between a planet’s symbolism and that of the sign in which it is exalted. For instance, the Moon, with its need for emotional security and support, obviously has strength in its exaltation sign, Taurus, which symbolizes the need for roots in the earth and for physical security. And</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Venus’s creative and artistic sides are reinforced by the mystical-spiritual qualities of its exaltation sign, Pisces.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But other connections are less obvious. For example, Saturn is exalted in Libra, the sign ruled by Venus, even though Saturn is usually considered to inhibit Venus. And while Mars is exalted in Capricorn, Saturn’s sign, Saturn is said to be in its fall in Aries, Mars’s sign. Why should one combination of Mars-Saturn symbolism be beneficial while the other is not? Of course part of the answer is that planets are not identical with the signs they rule: Mars is not Aries and Saturn is not Capricorn. But one would logically expect Mars in Capricorn to be just as conflicting as Saturn in Aries. Clearly, whatever logic there is in the assignment of planets to rulerships is lacking in the assignment of planets to exaltations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In his <i>Encyclopedia of Astrology </i>Nicholas DeVore attempts to find a pattern. He points out that using traditional rulerships (giving Scorpio to Mars, Aquarius to Saturn, and Pisces to Jupiter) the sign in which a planet is exalted is always in a three-series (traditionally favorable) aspect to one of the signs the planet rules. Thus Libra, Saturn’s exaltation, trines Aquarius, which Saturn rules; and Capricorn, Mars’s exaltation, sextiles Scorpio, which Mars co-rules. But Libra also squares Capricorn, Saturn’s other sign, and Capricorn squares Aries, so DeVore’s observation is not a convincing rationale.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ptolemy’s rationale is not much better. Reasonably enough, he assigns the Sun to Aries because in Aries day first becomes longer than night. But then he gives Saturn to Libra because Libra is opposite Aries, just as Saturn rules Aquarius, which is opposite the Sun’s rulership in Leo. This is pure schematicism, the assignment of relationships only because they seem elegant. Ptolemy assigns the other planets to their exaltations based on the seasonal changes and climate of ancient Greece, characteristics which would be quite different anywhere else. His reasoning looks suspiciously like after-the-fact observation, as if he had inherited a completed scheme and was trying to make sense of it, exactly as modern astrologers have attempted to do.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part83.htm#bookmark345" class="s31">There is another tradition in Western astrology that the exaltations and falls of planets are not just signs, but specific degrees, as shown in </a><a href="part83.htm#bookmark345" class="a">Table </a>8<span style=" color: #000;">, and herein may lie a clue to their origin. These degrees at first suggest that the exaltations are some kind of horoscope. But this is not possible because the exaltation of Mercury is more than 28° from that of the Sun. Pursuing a similar line of reasoning, however, the Irish siderealist Cyril Fagan has derived an interesting theory.</span></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse" cellspacing="0"><tr
