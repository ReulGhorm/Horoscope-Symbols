One’s most personal and intimate life. One’s family, both childhood and adult, one’s mother or father, one’s forebears, one’s native land. One’s past and relationship to tradition. Real estate, lands.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The end of life<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The core meaning of the fourth house is somewhat clear from the traditional interpretations. It is a house of inward and personal life, as opposed to outward and social concerns.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is also a house of matters that support one’s existence on both the physical and emotional levels. This support is different from second-house support. Money and material resources support one’s existence, but attachment to resources as extensions of the self, not support, is the crux of the second house. The primary house of support is the fourth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Yet the core symbolism of the fourth house lies deeper than this. To find it, we have to look at the meaning of the fourth-house cusp or I.C. As mentioned in the section on Taurus, the I.C. is the direction of the Earth from one’s place of birth, insofar as that direction can be shown in the zodiac. And the Earth is the basis of all support for life upon it. In the most literal sense, it is the support under our feet. In a broader sense, it is the ultimate support of our physical existence. It is the Great Mother: from its substance come our bodies, and later our food, clothing, and shelter. All fourth-house symbolism can be shown to spring from such images of the Earth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Our home, both physical and emotional, is our piece of Earth, where we settle down and put out roots. It is the place of intimate, personal life to which we retire after a day of confronting the outer, social world. Our family is, or at least should be, those people who not only share our roots, but also provide emotional support for us as we do for them. Our community is an extension of family, as is our native land. This is not a government or political order, it is one’s land as a physical place to which one belongs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The idea of <i>belonging </i>is one of the most important ways of distinguishing between the fourth house and the second. Second-house matters belong to oneself, whereas one belongs to fourth-house matters.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Real estate is our private piece of Earth, land on which we build our home. But I doubt that the fourth has anything to do with land bought for speculation; that seems to fall more into the fifth house, which is connected with speculation, or into the second, which has to do with possessions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The most controversial aspect of the fourth house is its connection with one of the parents. Which parent should be placed in the fourth, the father or the mother? For reasons that are not clear to me on either theoretical or empirical grounds, most astrologers place the father in the fourth and the mother in the tenth. But there is an almost equally strong tradition that reverses this, putting the mother in the fourth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I find that either parent may be symbolized by the fourth, depending on what role the parent is playing in the eyes of the child. The fourth house</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">symbolizes the parent as provider of the support system in early life, whereas the tenth symbolizes the parent as authority figure and disciplinarian. Both parents play a fourth-house role at various times. According to the sex roles still prevalent in our culture, the father usually provides the physical support, while the mother usually provides the emotional support and does more actual taking care of the children. Insofar as both parents discipline their children, they are tenth-house figures.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Nurturing, caring for, and providing a support system I call the maternal aspect of parenting, while teaching and disciplining I regard as the paternal aspect. But these two sides of parenting are not necessarily tied to the biological sex of the parents. This, I think, is why there is confusion about which parents are symbolized in the fourth and the tenth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Locked within the Earth are the traces of our past: rock strata from earliest ages, traces of ancient civilizations. Likewise, the fourth house signifies our past and our relationship to tradition. It symbolizes the physical structures, psychological patterns, attitudes, and memories that we inherit from the human race, from our immediate ancestors, and from life in and just beyond the womb.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most important, the fourth house represents what is buried in the psychological sense: the unconscious mind. We are referring not to Freud’s notion of a personal unconscious so much as to Jung’s notion of a collective unconscious. The collective unconscious is common to all humanity simply by the fact of our all being biologically similar. It is not a function of individual experience but comes through either heredity or experiences that are absolutely, inevitably common to us all regardless of cultural or individual variations. It is made up of brain processes that take place beneath our awareness, such that we cannot make them conscious even if we choose. Some of these are the functions of the autonomic nervous system; others are simply aspects of the brain’s functioning that we never become aware of except through symbolic patterns in our dreams, fantasies, and myths. The symbols of astrology operate at this level: each planet represents a complex of symbols in the collective unconscious.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark465">The collective unconscious serves, among other things, to connect us all to each other, and this is where its relationship to the fourth house comes in. It is not clear in Jung, but it is implicit in astrology and occult systems that at some level of the unconscious mind we are all in fact a single entity and that there are no boundaries separating individuals and possibly even species. Our connection with the oneness of life is obscured only by our reliance on the conscious mind. On a certain level we are always connected with everything, always at home everywhere. The collective unconscious,</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">symbolized by the fourth house, is the umbilical cord connecting us to all life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fourth house as the end of life is also clearly symbolized by the Earth. We are not only born from the Earth; in death we return our physical substance to it. The earth is both womb and tomb. As will be mentioned in the next chapter, the fourth house can be seen as both the beginning and the end of the cycle of houses.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Internal Level </b>At the innermost level, the fourth house symbolizes the psychic functions that connect us to the rest of life. It governs feelings of belonging, being at home in, and being connected. It is our link to the collective unconscious, to the psychological patterns we share with all human beings. It also symbolizes psychological structures that are genetically inbuilt or formed in earliest life. These are acquired preverbally and are so bound up with what we are that it is impossible to see them directly: we only deduce them through their products, such as dreams or odd bits of behavior. These aspects of the psyche are like the Earth, of which we as astrologers are largely unconscious. Probably because the Earth is so much a part of us, probably <i>because </i>it is the closest planet, we neglect to put it in the chart.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">At the level of our conscious relationship to other entities, the fourth house symbolizes our most intimate ties, those involving our family and others who support and nurture us, and later in life those whom we support and nurture. The fourth house thus shows the most personal and inward aspects of our social existence, those usually unseen by people outside our most intimate circle.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Because the fourth house also symbolizes this kind of intimate relationship, it relates to infant and even prenatal experiences, the consequences of which are unconscious and become part of the internal level of the house. Such experiences may or may not be sources of difficulty when they surface in adulthood as habits and behavior patterns whose function is not clear. Whereas third-house habits are once-conscious patterns that become deeply ingrained and forgotten, the origin of fourth- house habits is never conscious at all.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">The outermost level of the fourth house includes individuals like the nurturing parent and others with whom we have fourth- house relationships. It also includes our experience of our house, home, childhood and adult family, community, home town, nation, and so forth.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark466">Planets in the Fourth House </a><span class="p">A larger-than-average concentration</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of planets in the fourth house indicates the likelihood of a strongly personal, subjective manner of dealing with the world. Such people tend to be very private, and while not exactly withdrawn, they value being alone in their own space, or with those close to them. This is often an indication of introversion in every sense of the word.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If not nurtured in early life, later on such people can become withdrawn, emotionally insecure, and possessive. If well nurtured in childhood, later they can become nurturing and caring figures for others. There is often a strong maternal impulse, regardless of the individual’s sex.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">People with strong, well-functioning fourth-house planets have a feeling of belonging. To feel good, they do not need to prove themselves or go out and conquer the world. They accept life’s circumstances and are not easily upset by unexpected changes. They have an equilibrium and a psychological stability that most others lack.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto in the fourth, particularly if they are badly aspected, may indicate disturbances in giving and receiving nurture. Saturn in the fourth tends to restrict the flow of fourth-house energy so that one feels that nurture is limited or curtailed. Uranus signifies that the flow is erratic, unpredictable, or occurs in unusual ways. Neptune often gives the feeling that the nurturing flow is weak, without vitality, or occurs on an abstract, nonphysical level. Pluto in the fourth does not particularly restrict the flow of energy; in fact it may increase it to the point where one becomes trapped or bound by its effects, resulting in the persistence of infantile issues or behavior into adult life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part114.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part116.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
