First, there is the division of the horoscope into hemispheres, which has already been mentioned in </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a>12 <a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">and will be developed further in the second part of </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a>15<span style=" color: #000;">. There are also traditional groupings of houses that correspond to the groupings of the signs into elements and crosses.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">House Triplicities <span class="p">The triplicities or triangles of houses correspond roughly to the division of the signs into the four elements. In fact, authors such as Zipporah Dobyns consider the element of a house as significant as the element of a sign. To them, the first, fifth, and ninth are fire houses; the second, sixth, and tenth, earth houses; the third, seventh, and eleventh, air houses; and the fourth, eighth, and twelfth, water houses. This idea has some merit, but for the following reasons I do not accept it quite as formulated.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As said before, houses are not energies like planets, nor do they modify the manifestation of energies the way signs do. Elemental indications that come from planets and signs tell us about the style in which an individual behaves, whereas houses represent issues confronted in life. Houses describe where in one’s life one may act out or experience planetary energies. A planet in a so-called water house may or may not act in a watery manner, but it will confront watery issues. Therefore, to disregard the sign</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">272</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">on the cusp of a house or the planets in it, using instead whatever elemental quality the house may have as a house, is to change the purpose for which elements are intended in delineation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is also misleading. For example, judging from the number of important planets in my second and sixth houses, I have, from the house standpoint, a fairly strong emphasis in earth. But otherwise my earth credentials are slight: no planets in earth signs. Whatever earth qualities I have come from a Sun-Saturn opposition. Now, is the style of my behavior earthy? Those who point to my earth qualities say I am a reasonably orderly thinker and a careful worker. But these are air, not earth, qualities. A heavily earth person is impatient with excessive cerebration, something I am prone to, with Mercury conjunct the Sun. I am very involved in abstractions, which is not at all characteristic of earth. What my planets in “earth houses” do is deny me the luxury of ignoring practical affairs, though I would much prefer to ignore them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark448">While house and sign triplicities are not the same, the pattern of house triplicities is quite strong. For example, the fact that the fifth house is related to the first by house triplicity seems more influential than the fact that the fifth is on the experiencer side of the chart. Likewise, the twelfth house’s being related to the fourth is more important than its location on the actor side of the chart. Nevertheless, despite the obvious influence of the house triplicities, I have not found them as significant as the sign triplicities in getting an overview of the chart. In seeing the house cycle as a whole it is useful to organize the houses into triplicities, but in delineating I prefer to deal with the houses as individual entities rather than as members of groups.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whatever elemental qualities the houses may have, they do not have the same significance as the elements of signs and planets. Therefore, though there are elemental qualities in the descriptions that follow, I do not give elemental names to the triplicities of houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>personal houses </i>are one, five, and nine. The first house, signifying personal energy release into the world, sets the keynote for this triplicity. Whereas the first is oriented toward being effective in the world, the fifth house continues the theme of personal energy release, but is more oriented toward recreation and amusement. The ninth signifies one’s ability to perceive what is so about the external world and to make the resulting understanding part of one’s life and a tool to increase one’s effectiveness in the world. This triplicity corresponds to the fire signs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>practical houses </i>are two, six, and ten. Perhaps this is not the best term for them, but it is more accurate than calling them earth houses. It is better, perhaps, to consider them houses of what appears to be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">273</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">practicality. The issues of these houses may cause one to sacrifice short- term gratification or the expression of one’s will in order to get along in social reality, not physical reality. This is the chief reason why the term “earth” is not appropriate. The tenth house sets the tone here. It is a house of social status, role, and prestige. All these are socially defined. It is difficult to have social prestige in a vacuum. Money, usually associated with the second, is merely paper. Its value comes entirely from the social contract. The sixth in its aspect of signifying work that one does for others or that is done for oneself is also social. The health signification of the sixth is not, however, as clearly associated with the general nature of this triplicity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark449">The </a><i>social houses </i>are three, seven, and eleven. Whereas the practical houses are socially defined, the social houses signify relationships in the conventional sense. The third signifies the everyday, casual relationships (as with relatives and neighbors) that are so routine they do not usually surface as issues to be faced in life. The seventh deals with one- to-one relationships in which the individual must, at least to some degree, be aware of the other and be conscious of what is needed to make the relationship work. The eleventh relates to one’s interaction with groups (as well as to what one hopes for in life). Inasmuch as air is associated with the social function, these can be thought of as air houses, but inasmuch as air is associated with cerebration, only the third house has much to do with mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>unconscious houses </i>are four, eight, and twelve. All three have to do with either unconscious mental processes or the emotions. The fourth and twelfth are both houses of the unconscious mind, the fourth being the deepest level that ties one to one’s roots and origins, and the twelfth being the personal unconscious. The eighth has no obvious ties to the unconscious, but the issues associated with it seem to be heavily emotional. It has a sense of fate and brooding, and its association with death connects it to the most intense of all transitions into unconsciousness. At least, so it seems to others around the dying. These houses could be called water houses, except that the eighth is often associated with joint or shared finances, which is more of an earth than a water issue. All three houses appear to operate in hidden or mysterious ways.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">House Quadruplicities <a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">The quadruplicities of the houses are much more explicitly stated in traditional astrology than are triplicities of any kind. They are the angular, succedent, and cadent houses. And yet this is the division that has been most upset by the Gauquelin data mentioned at the beginning of </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">12</span><span class="p">.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traditionally, the angular houses (one, four, seven, and ten) have been considered the houses in which planets have their greatest effect. The</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">succedent houses (two, five, eight, and eleven), so called because going counterclockwise they succeed the angular houses, have been considered next in strength. The cadent houses (three, six, nine, and twelve), which take their name from the Latin <i>cadere</i>, “to fall,” were considered the weakest. Houses six and twelve are considered much weaker than three and nine.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part109.htm#bookmark450" class="s31">But the Gauquelin studies have clearly invalidated these traditional teachings. </a><a href="part109.htm#bookmark450" class="a">Figure </a><span style=" color: #00F;">27 </span>(adapted from page 52 of <i>Cosmic Influences on Human Behavior</i>) shows the typical pattern of planetary strength Gauquelin found. When studying the mundane position of various planets at the births of those who express those planetary energies strongly, he found a much greater than chance frequency of the appropriate planet in the twelfth and ninth houses, with smaller peaks in the third and sixth houses. In direct contradiction to the traditional teachings, the strongest areas were in the middle of the cadent houses, with the twelfth house being extremely strong.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Gauquelin data also show that planetary strength is not uniform within a house. And while there seems to be a fourfold rhythm of strong and weak in the daily cycle of a planet, there is no special tendency toward a twelvefold division. I retain the twelvefold division in this book as a convenient approximation rather than as a scheme of twelve clearly defined spaces.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 327pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="465" height="440" alt="image" src="Image_051.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark450">Figure 27. Mundane position and planetary strength</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Actually, not all tradition runs counter to the Gauquelin findings. The third and ninth houses have throughout most of Western tradition been considered much less weak than the other cadent houses. Also, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, in Hindu astrology the angular houses surround the horoscope angles, running from the middle of our cadent houses to the middle of our angular houses. Thus they include about half of each Gauquelin peak area.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">So far, I have only been talking about planetary strength in the houses, which is all Gauquelin talks about. But the traditional lore considers the angular houses not only strong but fortunate, and the cadent houses, at least six and twelve, not only weak but difficult. While I do not accept the cadent houses as weak, they do very often signal problems in a person’s life for reasons that I will detail below and at the end of </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a>15<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Following is a summary of some of the ideas that have been advanced about the qualities of the house quadruplicities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark451">The </a><i>cadent houses</i><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">—three, six, nine, and twelve—have traditionally been called mental houses. There is some merit to this, but it is hard to apply to the sixth house. The third house signifies the mind’s routine, daily processes, the ninth, its straining outward to comprehend the world, and the twelfth, the fears and phobias (among other things) that may condition its responses. Houses six and twelve seem to be critical, in that planets in these houses represent issues in life that must be handled well if they are not to become major sources of difficulty. The reasons for this are not at all clear from traditional views on houses; they will, however, become clearer in </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a><span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>succedent houses</i>—two, five, eight, and eleven—are often described as houses of resources. This is clear enough for the second and eighth, and can be seen to a lesser extent with the eleventh, but it makes little sense for the fifth. One traditional idea that definitely holds up is that planetary placement in succedent houses is a stabilizing influence. Planetary energies in these houses are not usually major sources of crisis (though a sufficiently conflicting combination of planets involving these houses can be difficult).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>angular houses </i>are one, four, seven, and ten. Though they do not occupy quite the preeminent position that tradition assigns, they are still quite strong. Zipporah Dobyns has suggested that these houses represent four types of relationship. The first represents independence or no relationship; the fourth, dependence, or the relationship of one needing care to those who</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">provide it; the seventh, interdependence, or the relationship between equals; and the tenth, dominance, or the relationship between one in authority and those who are subordinate. These are not, however, the same as the houses of relationship mentioned under triplicities. The relationships signified by the angular houses are not necessarily social relationships, as they signify the four main orientations between oneself and anything.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">In view of the Gauquelin data, it is hard to recognize the correspondence that is usually drawn between the angular houses and the cardinal signs, and between the cadent houses and the mutable signs. This is yet another instance of the need to keep houses and signs somewhat distinct. This correspondence will be examined further in </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a>15<span style=" color: #000;">. The terms “angular,” “succedent,” and “cadent” relate to a view of the houses that no longer seems valid, but we will continue to use them for the sake of their familiarity.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">House Polarities <a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="s31">An alternating positive and negative polarity is not as evident in the houses as in the signs, but there is probably some sort of similar effect. There is little about this issue in the literature. The problem is that one would expect negative houses to be passive with respect to the positive houses adjacent to them. But the active-passive polarity in houses seems more clearly related to the east-west polarity as described in </a><a href="part100.htm#bookmark423" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">12 </span><span class="p">than to alternating houses. Therefore, little use will be made of house polarity in this book.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part108.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part110.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
