Symbolic carriers of various energies, they move through the zodiac and are related to each other by aspects and qualified and colored by the signs and houses they occupy. But planets are not the only points in the horoscope. There are other points that can make aspects, and many of these points can also be modified by sign and house position much like planets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">These other points vary in usefulness. Some have obvious effects and provide information that would otherwise be unavailable from the chart; others have effects that are hard to discern and merely duplicate symbolism already present. The Ascendant and Midheaven are absolutely indispensable; the lunar nodes, the 0° Aries Point, and various midpoints add a great deal to chart interpretation; certain asteroids, fixed stars, hypothetical planets, the Vertex, and East Point promise to add valuable insights although I have not used them a great deal; and some other points I find merely add to the confusion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All points in the chart, including planets, fall into one of three categories. I will discuss node-type points first because they include those all-important horoscope angles, the Ascendant and Midheaven. Node-type points are formed by the intersection of two significant planes. They include not only the Ascendant and Midheaven, but also the other house cusps, newly proposed horoscope angles like the Vertex and East Point, lunar and planetary nodes, and the 0° Aries Point.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Body-type points are celestial bodies, either observed or hypothesized. Besides planets, these include asteroids, planetoids like the recently discovered Chiron, fixed stars, and the hypothetical planets proposed by various astrologers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark113">Planetary picture-type points arise from symmetrical arrangements of planets or other points around a single axis. Such arrangements produce sensitive points which take on importance when occupied. Arabian parts are</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the example most familiar to traditional astrologers, but midpoints and antiscia or solstice points are also based on this idea. The category takes its name from the Uranian school’s planetary pictures, which include all the other types in this category as special cases.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Even though these other points can in many ways be treated as planets, not all carry energies in the way that planets do. Body-type points carry energies, and planetary-picture type points carry energies insofar as they represent the combined energies of planets. But node-type points represent areas in which planetary energies can manifest. Thus, an aspect involving, say, Venus and the Ascendant might mean Venusian energies (warmth, harmony, etc.) expressed in one’s relations with others (signified by the Ascendant).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 254pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="338" alt="image" src="Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark114">Figure 4.
