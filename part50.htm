In fact, in the German schools that developed modem midpoint techniques, midpoints are taught to beginners. I can attest from personal experience that using them is simpler than many of the techniques for natal analysis taught by conventional astrologers. For these reasons I feel that midpoints should be taught in beginning astrology, if only because it is easier to integrate them into one’s chart-reading system early on than to make room for them later.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One reason using midpoints is actually simpler than one might suppose is that midpoint combinations involve only one kind of factor: planets and other points like the nodes, Ascendant, Midheaven, and 0°Aries. Even without mastering the symbolism of signs and houses one can derive an astonishing amount of information simply by combining planets and the like in aspects and midpoints. In fact, one of the German schools, that of Cosmobiology, manages quite well using signs very little and no houses at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: left;">I do consider the sign and house placement of a planet along with the midpoints in which it is involved, but this is not necessary to do at first.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While one is learning synthesis, one can take a midpoint combination, make a complete judgment from it, and then later combine that judgment with what is obtained from the sign and house placement. In this way one is not overwhelmed with material.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Modern midpoint techniques were developed by schools of astrology that were set up as alternatives to conventional systems, and therefore many people think that if they adopt midpoints they must adopt the whole alternative system in which midpoints were developed. But this is largely a misconception: to benefit from what midpoints can add, one need not give up the approach one already uses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part49.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part51.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
