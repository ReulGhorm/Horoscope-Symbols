It also adds an idea to “play” that is in fact intrinsic to the word but which has been lost in our modern attitudes. Play to many people today is trivial: an activity we all enjoy, but do not take seriously. In the late twentieth century, however, self-expression is taken almost as seriously as work. In fact many of us work hard at it, which is absurd when you stop to</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">think about it. As play and self-expression lie at the core of the fifth house, let us look at them more closely.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To survive, one ordinarily needs to perform certain functions: earn one’s bread, find shelter, and so forth. There are also many things we do either to get ahead or simply to survive in society. What all these activities have in common is that none is carried out for its own sake. They are only done out of necessity (real or imagined) or to serve some other purpose than the activity itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But some activities we do carry out for their own sake. It is simply in us to do these things: we want to, like to, and choose to do them. Doing them not only releases our own energies, it also makes a statement about who we are and what we are about. Making the statement is not the purpose of these activities, however; the important thing is that the activities are their own ends sufficient unto themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One may explore the depths of the universe simply because one wants to know what is there; one may develop athletic skills out of the exuberance of a body doing what it does well; or one may create works of beauty or deep meaning: art for art’s sake. There are even those who live their lives as a work of art.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Clearly, these activities are self-expressive and also playful. Both self-expression and play are pursued for their own sake. Even though they may in a subsidiary way do so, they do not <i>primarily </i>serve another purpose. Science—that is, pure science as opposed to technology—is essentially play. While we hear rhetoric about the usefulness of expanding our knowledge (and it often is useful), at the root science is the activity of people who enjoy asking questions about the universe. Many astrologers, including myself, have the same motivation. Science and astrology both</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">require work, but the work only serves the ultimate activity, which is play.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In fact, the role of work in general is to assist in play. Choosing to live is itself a decision to play the game of life. Even if, as Christianity teaches, life is for the purpose of glorifying God, it serves what is in fact God playing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Play is neither trivial nor unimportant. It is in fact what being is. Work, though necessary, is secondary: it serves the play. All activity must either be its own motivation, or must eventually serve the purpose of another activity that is its own motivation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fifth house is closely related to the first, which is also in the personal triplicity of houses. But unlike the first, the fifth does not imply an outer reality into which the energy is released. It is simply the domain of those energies within the self that want to be released for their own sake.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The strength of these energies may help an individual to put energy out into the world via the first house, but the energies of the fifth are not in themselves social.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This brings us to love affairs, which you would expect to belong to a relationship-oriented house. How, then, can the house of love affairs be a house of personal self-expression with little social dimension? The answer is that this house relates to only one aspect of love relationships: that of simple enjoyment, fun, an activity that is pursued for its own sake regardless of what it leads to. In its pure form, unmixed with other considerations, romantic love is glorying in a state of being for no other purpose than that it feels good.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">And ideally, love enhances self-expression. Through the eyes of a lover one finds new aspects of one’s being, and, being appreciated by another, these aspects flourish. An enormous proportion of our art has arisen from the self-expression of lovers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fifth house signifies dating and courtship, with their attendant fun. This is the stage for two people simply to enjoy being themselves with each other, with little thought of making a serious effort to operate as partners in a unit. The latter is the domain of the seventh house. A fifth- house relationship is less serious, less committed, and less of a close, one- to-one encounter.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To the older generation, the legal act of marrying established the transition from a primarily fifth-house to a primarily seventh-house relationship. But among many younger people there is no single act that does this. Moving in together may be like a legal marriage, but it can also be done so casually that the relationship is still not truly seventh-house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Obviously, a love relationship is not either fifth-house <i>or </i>seventh- house in nature: all love relationships are a mixture. The most committed marriage can have its aspect of two people simply enjoying each other, and the most casual relationship has some kind of dialectic going on between the two people.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another signification perhaps difficult to relate to the self- expression and play motif is having children. Children are a major source of responsibility. How can having a child be “play”? Clearly this is not play in the trivialized sense. But it <i>is </i>play as an activity that is an end in itself and as the release of an energy from within that expresses who and what one is.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Having a child serves no practical purpose for most people, a fact that has been brought out in much anti-childbearing literature of late. Yet people choose to have children. Even teenage girls who ought not to have children because of their age and level of maturity often have them because</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of something it means to them, something that cannot easily be expressed in practical terms. It can be argued that having children is a form of self- expression, in which people create variations on themselves and also transmit something of who they are. Also, through one’s children one re- establishes touch with the tendency to play and exuberant self-expression of one’s own childhood.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Having children is clearly play in the expanded sense: it isn’t all fun. As with other play there is work attendant to it (think of an athlete’s training, which is also work subsidiary to play). There is also often pain, beginning with the pangs of childbirth. These are the pangs of creation, shared by mothers and artists alike. Getting what is to be expressed out of the self is not always easy. And what is expressed is not always pretty: children don’t always turn out well, and tragedies like <i>Hamlet </i>are also a form of play.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fifth house was not the only or even the primary house of children in natal astrology until the twentieth century. In older books children were signified by the tenth, eleventh, fourth, and fifth houses in that order. The fourth and tenth both signify kinds of parenting, and as such also relate to those toward whom one plays a parenting role. The eleventh signifies relationships to groups of all kinds, one’s own family being the primary instance of such a relationship. The fifth house signifies the actual creative act of bringing children into the world. This older way of looking at children through the horoscope of a parent covers parenting as a multi- aspected process, and seems to me much more complete than merely looking at the fifth house alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The remaining meanings of the fifth house are gambling, speculation, and investments. All are essentially gambling (I would limit fifth-house investments to speculative ones). As gambling, they fit into the fifth house as a form of amusement.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Does gambling’s chance element relate to the core meaning of the fifth? Perhaps. There is certainly a chance element in the creation of a child: which sperm gets to the egg is not unlike a horserace or a game of roulette. And in art as well as childbearing, one can never be sure of how the product of one’s creative self-expression will turn out. Like a gambler one throws one’s energies out into the world with a certain recklessness and never can be quite sure of the return.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">The fifth house symbolizes those parts of the psyche that wish to express the nature of the self. As a symbol of being, the fifth is “being myself.” It represents a drive to play out the role one has chosen.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">298</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In another sense it represents a drive to create. The fifth house is a place of energies within the individual trying to get out; as they come out, they give the individual a feeling of being alive and unique. These energies may or may not require another individual for their complete expression.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">On the self-other level, the fifth is the house of all relationships that are formed mainly for pleasure or self-expression. This includes love affairs and also just the enjoyment of being with another person of whom one is fond.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fifth house also signifies one’s relationship to the product of one’s spontaneous creative activity. This is one way the fifth relates to childbearing. This is the primary house to consult about how childbearing, as opposed to child-rearing, will work out. (For child-rearing, see houses ten and four.)</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At this level is our experience of external-world fifth-house entities like places of amusement, gambling, and speculation. Also at this level is the fifth-house component of one’s experience of one’s children.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark468">Planets in the Fifth House </a><span class="p">A preponderance of planets in the fifth house signifies an individual who has a strong need to release abundant energies. Often the individual has much to give out—ideas, creativity, and exuberant energies—but is not so good at receiving the same things from others. Usually these are people one would describe as fun-loving, but this depends on the planets involved.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whereas most planets simply signify what kind of energy will enter into one’s creative self-expression, Saturn is notoriously contrary to the nature of the fifth house. People with this placement may have difficulty releasing the energies of the fifth. They may be more serious than most, or find it hard to have a good time unless they can find a “significant” reason for doing what they want to do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part115.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part117.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
