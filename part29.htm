Unfortunately, however, its action is drastic. Whereas Saturn creates a neat and orderly but sometimes oppressive universe in which one feels one knows what is happening, Uranus intrudes with an energy that is unexpected and often disruptive. Uranus energies strive to break one out of patterns that have become too rigid, even though one may wish to stay within them. Or, if one has already recognized that some Saturnine aspect of life has one in a stranglehold, Uranus can represent the desire to break free of it. It is an energy that strives to keep the universe flexible by preventing too much order. Uranus represents the random element of mutation that is necessary for creative innovation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although Uranus is the first of the outer planets that are normally invisible to the naked eye, it can be seen under ideal conditions when in opposition to the Sun. Uranus’s position on the periphery of awareness symbolizes the way its energies tend to peep in and out of the world of normal consciousness, and how they often seem to be alien to the concerns</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of normal consciousness. Its energies operate suddenly and with extreme eccentricity. Whatever it may affect or symbolize takes the form of something unusual, far different from the everyday world. Uranus can therefore be more truly consciousness-expanding than Jupiter. Whereas Jupiter represents expansion into worlds that are at least similar to those with which one is already familiar, Uranus can bring about encounters with totally alien worlds. Along with Neptune, it is associated with alternative states of consciousness. It is said to rule enlightenment. It is the lightning flash that illuminates a dark landscape, the flash itself being totally discontinuous with the darkness that preceded it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus is often experienced as malefic—that is, difficult. Most of us are sufficiently comfortable in our reality systems so that we do not welcome elements that violate it. The problem with Uranus is being ready for it, and most people are not. To the extent that one is dominated by the negative side of Saturn, Uranus will be experienced as traumatic. But if one is ready for change and new experiences, Uranus can be life-restoring.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In order really to take advantage of Uranus, however, one must have grown to a certain point in the manner of Saturn. One must have created a certain amount of structure in life and gained a certain degree of maturity. In order for the Uranian alteration of structure to be useful, there must be a structure to alter. Uranus energies coming too soon in life can cause a chronically erratic quality that prevents any kind of maturation and produces an individual incapable of taking part in the social contract. Such people are automatic rebels: they rebel simply to negate order, even when order is still useful.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This is not to decry the rebellions of the young against their elders. Such rebellions are natural and proper Uranian crises which prevent any generation from getting a stranglehold on the next. To some extent each generation must form a structure that embodies its own nature. Uranus assists the young in breaking free of their parents so they can create their own order. All people must eventually create some kind of order in their lives so they can achieve what they wish. Then, when they have attained their goals, the power of Uranus can return to transform and restructure their lives. Thus achievements become not ends in themselves but only steps on a longer path. Left alone, Saturn causes people to stop at some point and be totally satisfied with the status quo. When this happens, life becomes a downward process, and one begins to perceive life as being less and less of what it once was. The individual who learns to handle Uranus is able to continue growing throughout life.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In order to deal with Uranus, detachment is necessary. One must not</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">be wedded to any status quo. One must be ready to experience anything and to give up anything. Those who have given up possessions, social position, and cherished ideas are not held hostage against creative change by what they have. Most people cling to a Saturnine security even when this causes much pain and a diminished sense of being alive. As Uranian energies threaten, these people hold on harder, and Uranus becomes even more threatening and painful. The more easily one can let go, the more easily one can use the energies of Uranus positively.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When I was young, everyone in my town was amazed when a native son came back home after being vice-president of a large corporation. He was tired of being in business and wanted to do something else. He completely changed his life in order to reestablish touch with being alive. This is the Uranian way.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This detachment can be another source of difficulty with Uranus because it does not care about individual concerns. Uranus is a force of nature that operates outside human culture. It often takes the form of revolutions, natural disasters, and other disruptions that break down Saturnine order. Many people suffer when this happens. Uranus at these times is terrifying, and it is not clear that it is a force for aliveness. The destruction seems gratuitous, and most individuals do not benefit. Uranus has a ruthless side: Uranian people often have no concern for individuals at all, but only for a process of revolutionary change with which they have identified. In this identification one can see the transpersonal quality of Uranus as individuals completely bury their own egos in a cause.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark102">It is best not to worry about or resent the ruthless side of Uranus. It is simply the way nature works. Nature is not completely reliable and predictable, and it does not always conform to our Saturnine expectations. In the face of this fact, one must be prepared to take advantage of Uranus’s structure-annihilating powers, powers that can re-create aliveness and reestablish touch with the living self that has been buried by Saturn’s structure. Interestingly, in times of natural disaster many people feel more alive than they ever do in normal times. Dealing with disaster brings out something creative in human nature, even in the midst of suffering.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some people embody Uranian energies for society as a whole. They exist to challenge society’s outworn structures and bring about change. Depending on the orientation of those who view them, they may be feared as dangerous revolutionaries or admired as reformers. Clearly, the more Saturnine elements of society, the reactionaries and conservatives, will feel threatened. Society can be like the individual who exacerbates a Uranian crisis by trying to prevent it from manifesting. If society resists too</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">successfully, the Uranian element goes underground and bides its time. Meanwhile, the culture goes into a period of stagnation, only to erupt later on. The peculiar apathy of the nineteen fifties came partly from stifling Uranian energies during the early fifties’ anti-Communist hysteria. But the Uranian energies then erupted much more strongly in the sixties. In the seventies another period of deadness settled over America. Was this also the result of stifling Uranian energies, and will it cause more violent eruptions in the future?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Astrologers have long associated Uranus with innovative technologies like electronics, computers, aeronatics and astronautics, and also with sciences such as chemistry, physics, and mathematics—all fields that have brought radical change in our world. But when scientists become spokesmen for the social order and try to determine what people shall and shall not believe, it is questionable whether they are still Uranian. Science in all its forms is both Uranian and Saturnine, but some scientists are predominantly Saturnine. It is worth noting that Saturnine scientists have seldom been the most creative, and when they have, their creative work has usually been done in youth, before the Saturnine hardening of their attitudes. Uranus represents the intuitive flash that leads to new discovery and the overturning of old ideas, while Saturn represents the systematic plugging away involved in testing ideas. Science requires a balance between these energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark103">Other fields with revolutionary potential are also Uranian. Though individual astrologers may project the energies of Saturn, Neptune, or other planets, astrology itself is plausibly Uranian. This is because astrology works with flashes of intuition gained directly from a symbolic study of the cosmos. The student of astrology can gain direct knowledge of religious, metaphysical, and spiritual truths without having to be guided by priests or other representatives of the established philosophical order. Here is the real reason why astrology has gone in and out of favor. Unlike most of the orthodox (the very word “orthodox” is Saturnine) sciences, what astrology teaches has profound social implications, a fact obscured by the conservatism of many astrologers. In this respect, astrology is more like a social science, which often has controversial things to say about the world. But at the time astrology fell out of favor there were no social sciences to speak of, and I doubt that any would have been tolerated. The physical sciences became acceptable once it became clear that they would have little to say about social realities, and that they were useful for military purposes.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One of the essential features of Uranian fields of study is that they are very mind-oriented. Uranus does not touch the feelings the way that, say,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">the Moon, Venus, or Neptune do. While it does not necessarily follow traditional canons of logic or reason, the Uranian mind does operate in ways that reason can relate to. In fact, Uranian people will often carry an idea out to an extent that is positively inhuman. This is another aspect of the ruthlessness of Uranus. The engineer who can only think of increasing the power of his or her technology, regardless of the human cost, is a true negative Uranian type. The positive consequences of his or her activities must be integrated into society without letting the negative side run rampant. Uranus may signify death through accident, injury, or natural disaster, but at least it never signifies the death-in-life that is characteristic of Saturn. Thus, although Uranus energies can be extremely difficult to live with, the measure of chaos that they introduce is essential for life. Life is to a great extent a balancing of the orderly forces of Saturn with the chaotic forces of Uranus. Each has its place, and each needs to be kept in check by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the other.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part28.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part30.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
