This is not because other aspects are of little significance, as other authors have stated; rather, it is because their principles are not as clearly formulated by astrologers as are those of the aspects we have already taken up. If you do choose to examine these aspects, do so in the spirit of research and do not take any written formulation of them as anything but hypothesis. With the aspects already in general use, the disagreements, such as they are, are not so much about the essences of the aspects as about the precise ways of formulating them into words. With these other aspects, even the essences are in question.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Having given this warning, I would like to describe for the student’s guidance the formulations of these aspects that I have found thus far to be the most useful. I stress again, however, that these are hypothetical. Occasionally I will use the symbolism of planets to suggest interpretations of these aspects, but it must be kept in mind that aspects are not planets; they are ways in which planets are linked. Analogies to planets are drawn only to suggest ways of approaching the aspects.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark218">The Five-Series </a><span class="p">These are aspects based on the division of the circle by the number five and its multiples, such as ten, fifteen, and twenty. The basic aspect is the quintile (72°, or one-fifth of the circle). Other members of this family include the biquintile (144°, or two-fifths), the</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">139</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">decile (36°, or one-tenth) and multiples of 36°, and the vigintile (18°, or one-twentieth) and multiples of 18°. All these aspects seem to have a quality that we usually associate with Pluto, with overtones of Venus and Mars. They seem to link planets in such a way that some kind of concrete creation or destruction is brought about. The number five has a connection with life, death, and mortality; the pentagram is the figure of humankind. John Addey, one of the leading researchers in the field of non-traditional aspects, believes that the five-series has to do with the intellectual function and all those affairs that are peculiarly human. My own observations confirm his, with the reservation that to say “intellectual quality” does not mean rarefied, dry, or detached. In my experience, the five-series aspects have a great deal of emotional tone.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Addey has suggested that intellect is the most characteristic attribute of humankind, and that therefore the number of humankind would be a number of intellect. But there is a second unique attribute of human beings, which is partly a result of their intellect, but also of something else in their nature harder to pin down. They have <i>transformed </i>their environment and the Earth in general far more than any other species. Nor have they ever been able to attain a constant balance with the environment. Some cultures have achieved more of a balance than others, but even these are usually overthrown by another, more aggressive culture eventually. Cultures rise and fall, and the only thing that we can assume is constant about human history is change. And the changes seem to come from deep within the human spirit. Most cultures cannot survive long periods without change. They atrophy and die or go through fundamental revolution. This transforming I associate with the five-series. People I have known with many such aspects seem to have their lives bound up in some way with the fundamental energies of change. This may show up in an exaggerated concern with power, or with innermost truths about the universe that enable one to know first-hand how the transforming energies work. On the negative side, we have the chart of Adolf Hitler, the only outstanding feature of which is its string of five-series aspects. On the positive side, we have the chart of Albert Einstein, a man who spent his life exploring the secrets of the universe (and, in support of Addey’s position, with a great deal of intellect).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The other major characteristic of these aspects, and the one longest noted, is that they seem to grant the ability to turn creative inspiration into concrete end-products. They have long been noted as aspects of talent or even of genius, but more recent work suggests that these aspects do not in themselves grant the creative inspiration.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One last comment: the quintile and the biquintile, the two most powerful aspects in this group, appear to be extremely so, perhaps more than all the three-series aspects except for the trine. One reason this has not been noted before is that older astrologers simply logged aspects as good or evil. The quintile and biquintile do not clearly fit into either category.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark219">The Seven-Series </a><span class="p">The division of the circle by seven produces the septile (51° 25’ 42.9”). Its multiples are 102° 51’ 25.7” (the biseptile) and</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">154° 17’ 08.6” (the triseptile). There is also the semiseptile of 25° 42’ 51.4” and its various multiples. These are the only aspects whose angle does not evenly divide into 360° so as to produce a whole number. The decimal and sexagesimal fractions that occur in these numbers repeat to infinity. This is probably one reason why these aspects have been overlooked. They are extremely hard to see without measuring them in a chart with a protractor.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The seven-series aspects are difficult to formulate in rigorous and clear terms. Part of the reason is that they have a Uranus-Neptune flavor, which suggests that they have to do with energy linkings that are not entirely of this world. For example, these aspects are prominent in the chart of Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the Theosophical movement. They are also prominent in the charts of poets. If the five-series gives the ability to turn creative inspiration into concrete end-products, the seven-series gives the creative inspiration itself. It is as if these aspects enable one to peer outside the everyday universe into one of expanded possibilities and truths.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are dangers here also. I have seen the seven-series indicate mental and emotional difficulties as well as creative inspiration. An excess of these aspects appears to give one a lack of connection with the physical universe as most of us know it. This is the dangerous or at least difficult side of creative inspiration.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part47.htm#bookmark235" class="s31" name="bookmark220">The seven-series also shows up in connection with religion. In a study of the distribution of the birth Suns of ministers in both Britain and America, John Addey discovered that minister’s Suns tend to cluster near the points of a seven-sided polygon in the zodiac.</a>* <span style=" color: #000;">The effect was more noticeable with British clergymen than with American. It has been suggested that perhaps this is because the British clergy are more concerned with the traditional ceremonial aspects of religion than are their American counterparts; I leave that speculation to the reader.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Nine-Series <span class="p">These are aspects based on multiples of 40 °, which is the division of the circle by nine. The 40° aspect itself is called the novile or nonile. It has rarely been used in the West, but it is important in</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India, although it is not used there in exactly the way we use aspects. In Hindu astrology it is said to describe what the life produces in the long run, and also the individual’s needs and capacities in relationships, especially marriage. As a describer of the end-products of life, the nine-series seems related to the traditional meaning of the number nine as completion and ending. The second use, for marriage, has been corroborated in Western sidereal astrology, which uses the noviens, a type of chart based on the nine- series, to describe sexual attractions.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark221">Higher Harmonics </a><span class="p">Little is known about aspects based on divisions of the circle by numbers larger than nine. All that can safely be said is that they may have considerable significance. Many astrologers of the old school would have us believe that nothing but the original aspects (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, and opposition) used by the Greeks have any significance whatsoever. This is clearly not true, but further research is needed to determine just what the significance of the higher harmonics is. The one limiting factor in the use of higher harmonics is the accuracy of the horoscope, as the higher the harmonic, the greater the magnification of any error in a planet’s longitude. In other words, the higher the harmonic, the smaller the allowable orb.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 600pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="800" alt="image" src="Image_030.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark222">Figure 12.
