It is very socially oriented, feeling completely at home in a context defined by its social milieu. Though negative in polarity, Capricorn is far from passive. Capricorn may allow the external world to define its criteria about what is and is not real, important, and acceptable, but having once accepted these definitions and even gloried in accepting them, it turns with gusto to play the game according to these rules.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To truly understand Capricorn, it is necessary to understand the horoscope’s symbolism of the father-complex, of which Capricorn is a manifestation on the sign level. Capricorn is unusually subject to the influence of authority figures and of those who claim knowledge that is universally applicable (that is, objectively real). It tends to place relatively little emphasis on its own subjective viewpoint. Yet, and here is an apparent contradiction of the type, Capricorn eschews abstractions that cannot be reduced to experience. Capricorn is concerned with an objective idea of truth that is at the same time experienceable. Thus Capricorn arrives at an idea of truth that it grants absolute reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">And the truth must work for oneself. This means not only that Capricorn accepts what society considers real, but also that Capricorn sets out to be effective in practical terms. Efficacy is something Capricorns desire above all else. The idea of being dependent on others and not in control of oneself terrifies a Capricorn. The sign would rather control others, although it usually has too much of a sense of responsibility to be power-mad.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Capricorn desires to take the rules it has been taught about the external world and use them as well as possible to build a monument to its own existence. It wants to be able to say to the world, “I did it, I built that.” Whatever it builds must be important not only to the Capricorn but also to the world whose rules the Capricorn has tried to master.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark387">Not only is Capricorn in early life particularly subject to authority in determining its views of reality; later on, it itself becomes the embodiment of that authority. Again we have the association between Capricorn and the father archetype: the energy that tells the child that it must not only be wrapped up in its own life, it must also come to terms with what exists outside the self. As Cancer is the sign manifestation of the infant’s support system, so Capricorn is the sign manifestation of the energy that thrusts the child out of the home into the world.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Both Sagittarius and Capricorn may pose as representatives of the social order, but they differ in how they do it. Sagittarius is concerned with the principles that unify society, and with theories of social integration. Often it desires understanding purely for the sake of its own consciousness expansion (even though it is not, like Gemini, entranced by ideas purely as ideas).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Capricorn, on the other hand, is not concerned about principles so much as their practical implementation. It wants to know what is “really real,” not what is theoretically true. Capricorn is more concerned with the social order’s details than its generality.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We might consider Sagittarius the academic philosopher of the social order and Capricorn the businessman. Again the principles of the fire sign are enabled to manifest on the physical plane by the earth sign that follows it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Clearly, Sagittarius and Capricorn should be a team. Yet their psychology is so different that it is hard for them to get along. Sagittarius is unhappy about what it conceives as Capricorn’s grubby materialism and inordinate social ambition, and Capricorn is unhappy about Sagittarius’s tendency to take flight into airy abstractions and avoid the responsiblity of handling the “real” world. Yet when the two do get together, the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">understanding of Sagittarius is truly impressive when combined with the practical effectiveness of Capricorn.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Capricorn’s only serious problem is that it is so bound up in being effective in the “real” world it does not play easily. An activity is only justifiable to a Capricorn if it is significant. This causes Capricorns both to be overly serious and to rationalize. There may be something a Capricorn really enjoys doing, but to be enjoyable is not enough. Capricorn must convince itself that what it enjoys is also socially important. Therefore, Capricorn reasons, it has more of a right to what it enjoys than do others to their less “important” amusements. Capricorn likes to pat itself on the back for “doing its duty” when it is in fact only doing something it enjoys. The Capricorn often identifies play with work.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Despite the serious nature of the sign, Capricorn has produced more than its share of humorists. The humor is usually of the wry, self- deprecating, rather than playful kind, and is probably Capricorn’s way of maintaining a sane balance in the face of its tendency toward seeking importance.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark388">The Relationship of Capricorn to Saturn </a><span class="p">Capricorn and Saturn are very similar. Both strive for material achievement, and both are strongly concerned with social recognition. Both are symbols of self-denial and the deferral of immediate gratification in favor of long-range necessity. Both are strongly connected to the father and to all symbols of authority and guidance, and in both discipline is strong. But Capricorn is usually more like a positive Saturn: it is not quite as strongly repressive as the planet.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed, the main differences between Capricorn and Saturn are ones of strength and degree. That is, Saturn aspecting a planet has a much more powerful effect than that planet’s simply being in Capricorn. Being in Capricorn almost never signifies a serious denial of a planet’s energy in the way that being aspected by Saturn may. Only in a heavily earthy and watery chart with inactive fire signs and planets can Capricorn become as difficult an influence as Saturn.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Capricorn on Planets <span class="p">Planets in Capricorn tend to increase one’s reality orientation and may limit one’s ability to get outside the social viewpoint in which one was reared. For this reason, the sign is best with those planets that are not especially concerned with freedom and innovation. Uranus is probably not at its best in Capricorn. Neither is Jupiter, though I have observed that Jupiter in Capricorn is not as tense a combination as Saturn in Sagittarius. Jupiter is often quite happy to turn its attention to the achievement of social status and importance.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some authorities feel that Jupiter in Capricorn may signify problems with the father. But Jupiter, which remains in a sign for one year, cannot, I think, simply by being in Capricorn foul up an entire year’s worth of children’s relationships with their fathers. Of course, the father-child relationship may be strained if the Jupiter in Capricorn is otherwise prominent. My own feeling is that this is one of those debates that is too subtle to be settled.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mars is said to be exalted in Capricorn. This does not entirely make sense, since one would not expect the combination of Mars energies and Saturn-like Capricorn energies to be easy. Yet it does seem that Mars energy in Capricorn is disciplined rather than blocked. In Capricorn, Mars energy is turned away from its narrow ego-orientation and given a larger social basis so that others are more likely to respect one’s intentions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Strongly emotional planets do not do well in Capricorn because the sign tends to repress emotion in favor of discipline. The Moon is particularly difficult here, because Capricorn will not allow the Moon to enjoy being dependent on others, a mode of relationship that is absolutely essential to the Moon’s functioning at some point in life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Venus is also not at its best, because its emotional criteria for choice are likely to be subordinated to practical criteria. Venus in Capricorn can also indicate an attraction to older persons who can serve as authority figures as well as lovers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark389">Whatever a planet’s normal inclinations may be, in Capricorn they are subjected to practical considerations and must be made to serve the sign’s need for effectiveness. If this is not done they operate ambiguously and therefore tensely. One wonders what Neptune in Capricorn will be like.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part95.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part97.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
