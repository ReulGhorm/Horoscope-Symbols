Above it, the planets are visible; below it, they are blocked from view by the mass of the Earth. This symbolizes the split we feel between inner and outer, subjective and objective. If you will again visualize yourself lying in the field, the horizon represents your eyes or your skin. Everything above the horizon is in front of your eyes or outside your skin. You can see what is “out there” objectively; you perceive it as other than yourself. But what is below the horizon is behind your eyes or inside your skin. You cannot see it; you can only deduce its presence. Except when you make an effort, you are unaware of it, because it is so much a part of you.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The horizon can be the boundary between what we perceive as inner and outer, but, as I will show with the houses at the end of the next chapter, the horizon can also be interpreted as the boundary between many other sorts of realm. It depends on what level of reality you are talking about. The horizon can act as a boundary between I and thou, we and they, mine and yours, or even personal and nonpersonal aspects of the world. Or, entirely within one’s psyche, the horizon can be the boundary between the conscious and the unconscious mind.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Upper Hemisphere <span class="p">In general, the part of the horoscope that is above the horizon is associated with those aspects of life that are less personal and more social. It represents the not-self, the outer self, other people, the social world, the more conscious mind, one’s role in the social world, thou, they, and the future.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Lower Hemisphere <span class="p">The part below the horizon is more personal and less social. It symbolizes the self, the inner self, one’s closest family and associates, the less conscious mind, the basis of one’s conception of self, I, we, and the past. I use comparative rather than absolute adjectives to make it clear that the upper-lower split is relative rather than fixed.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Ascendant <span class="p">When planets rise or cross the horizon in the east, they are passing from the inner realm to the outer. This is the point where energies from the self are made manifest to the not-self. In other words, this is a point of self-manifestation. One would expect this point to govern the effect or impression one has on the outer world, or the kind of action one takes upon the world. Here energies emerge from the individual (lower hemisphere) and begin to affect others (upper hemisphere). This is why the Ascendant is often related to the personality, personality being defined as</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the outermost aspect of one’s inner being. It has also been related along with the whole first house to the form, health, and general state of the physical body.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark433">The Descendant </a><span class="p">The Descendant is where planets set, or cross the horizon in the west, passing from the outer realm to the inner. The logical as well as the spatial opposite of the Ascendant, it relates to the kind of impression the not-self makes upon the self, the effect of the immediate environment upon one, or the kind of action the world makes upon the self. To put it more precisely, since we have seen that the horoscope indicates one’s experience of things, not their objective reality, the Descendant relates to one’s experience of energies from others and the outside world. Even more precisely, the Descendant describes those aspects of oneself that one experiences through relationships with others. Therefore, it also describes what one looks for in others, whether consciously or not. In this respect the Descendant is much like the seventh house.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Horizon Axis <a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31">From the above meanings, you can see why in </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">5 </span><span class="p">the horizon axis, consisting of the Ascendant on one end and the Descendant on the other, was said to relate to self-other interactions. The general situation of this axis by aspects, midpoints, and sign placement is important in determining how well an individual will get along with others at close range. The relationships signified are of an intimate kind; I do not find this axis a good index of how well one gets along with groups, where both one’s own individuality and that of others is less clearly defined than in a one-to-one situation.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part102.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part104.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
