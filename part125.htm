But in discussing the eighth house I mentioned that at least some of its meanings come from the relationship of the eighth to other houses. For example, its meaning “other people’s money” can be derived from the eighth house being the seventh house (other people) from the second (money). Or its being “the partner’s money” can be derived from the eighth being the second house (money) from the seventh (the partner). These meanings do not follow directly from the core meaning of the eighth. They are derived, as</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">opposed to intrinsic, meanings.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31" name="bookmark490">Although derived meanings do not follow directly from core meanings, I feel that in a certain way the core meanings are ultimately derived from the relationship of the houses to each other. After all, houses are stages in the day cycle, and the nature of any stage in a cycle comes from its unique relationship to every other stage. I have touched on the relation of the houses to each other in the section “Classifying the Houses” in </a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="a">Chapter 13 </a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31">and in the house delineations themselves </a><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="s31">in </a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="a">Chapter 14</a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31">. In the section </a>to come I would like to show more explicitly how the meaning of a house can arise from its being in opposition, square, trine, sextile, semisextile, or quincunx to one of the other eleven houses. I will not only show how deriving house meanings from aspect relationships can give new insights into houses, but also how it can help you to interpret empty houses. Before getting to this, however, I find it necessary to dispose of a common and, I think, totally misguided, way of deriving house meanings.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Deriving House Meanings from House Relationships <span class="p">Derived meanings are often used so that every house is read as if it were the first house for the issue with which that house is associated. For example, taking the third house as the house of one’s brothers and sisters, you can look at the fourth house as the second house from the third. This would make the fourth the house of the money or possessions of one’s brothers and sisters. The horoscope’s ninth house would be read as the seventh from the third, signifying the marriages and partnerships formed by one’s brothers and sisters. The horoscope’s seventh house would be the fifth from the third (the house in question is always counted as the first) and would indicate the children of one’s brothers and sisters. And so forth.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">According to the best evidence I have seen, this way of using derived house meanings was not originally applied to natal horoscopes at all, but was brought over to natal work from horary astrology. Horary astrology is a technique for answering specific questions, like “When will my lawsuit be settled?” or “Which team will win the World Series?”. It seldom uses the natal horoscope, but instead uses a chart drawn up for the moment the question is asked. Suppose the question is “What will happen to my brother?”. The horary astrologer would read all the houses as if the third house (brothers and sisters) were the first, just as I outlined above, looking at the fourth as the brother’s finances, the fifth as the brother’s neighbors and other siblings, the sixth as the brother’s home, and so on around the circle.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is easy to see how a natal astrology primarily interested in fortunetelling would adopt horary’s method of using derived house meanings, because this method can cover specific questions about almost</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">329</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">any conceivable issue. But just as I question a fortunetelling approach in natal astrology, I also question reading the houses in this way. Derived house meanings like this work best in an astrology that is trying to be definite about future events, which implies that such events cannot be changed. Yet neither I nor most other modern astrologers believe the future is immutable.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark491">These meanings work well </a><i>only </i>with simple-minded, concrete house interpretations. With the core psychological meanings from which these more superficial meanings originate, they work ungracefully at best. Even if it is not philosophically profound, the derived fifth-house meaning “a parent’s money” is at least clear. But when the fifth house is reinterpreted as the second house from the fourth in terms of the basic psychological significance, it becomes “the attachments to the physical world of the energies associated with one’s experience of nurture.” Even if one could make sense out of this, its relation to the core idea of the fifth, “activities pursued for their own sake,” remains obscure.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Basing derived house interpretations on core meanings may produce nonsense, but basing them on fortunetelling meanings implies that the superficial meanings are more fundamental than the psychological and philosophical ones. This cannot be so. If it were, it would mean that your tenth house is not the experience of fathering energies, but is literally your father as an objectively real person, and that every other house describes not your experience of reality but the reality itself. If that is so, what do you do with two brothers, one with Saturn conjunct Neptune in the tenth, and the other with Jupiter in the tenth trining the Sun? They had the same father, yet their experience of fathering differed. Obviously the symbolism does not describe the reality of the father or father figures, but the experience of being fathered. Any other system of core meanings would have the same problem with derived house significations, as long as it was based on the idea that houses describe not objective realities, but energies that modify experience.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="s31">My other objection to using horary-type derived house meanings in natal astrology is similar to my objection to using planetary dignities to connect planets to houses (see </a><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="a">Chapter </a>10<span style=" color: #000;">). It increases the possibilities for interpretation to the point where a single house can mean almost anything. To give an example, does an indication in the fifth house pertain to one’s having children (intrinsic meaning), to one’s parent’s finances (second from the fourth), to the death of the other parent (eighth from the tenth), or to one of nine other possible meanings? How are we to judge which meaning is the important one? In horary, the possibilities are narrowed down by the</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">330</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">question asked, but in natal astrology the things one could say about a person are almost infinite. Such a wide set of possibilities with no guidelines for judging which is the strongest can only create confusion when you are trying to make sense out of a situation. As with other suspect techniques, this one is useful chiefly when an astrologer is either (a) psychic or (b) trying to explain an event after it has happened.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark492">Deriving House Meanings from Aspect Relationships </a><span class="p">The above idea of house interpretations implies that houses are more fundamental than aspects. Indeed, many astrologers think that the aspects derive their meanings from house relationships. Therefore, their reasoning runs, all squares have the nature of the relationship between the fourth or tenth house to the first, so that all squares affect relations with one parent or the other. Similarly, all trines have a fifth- or a ninth-house quality; all oppositions, a seventh-house quality; and so on. But modern evidence indicates that things are in fact the other way around: houses derive their meanings—in part, at least—from the aspects.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Houses make mundane aspects to each other, as opposed to the zodiacal aspects we are more used to dealing with. Houses aspect each other in the plane on which the particular house system is based. Only in equal house systems is this plane the ecliptic. Rather than being whole- number subdivisions of a planet’s progress around the zodiac, aspects between houses are usually whole-number subdivisions of the various ways astrologers measure the daily rotation of the Earth. Thus the fourth house is in a non-ecliptic square to the first, the fifth in a trine, the sixth in a quincunx, and so forth.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="s31">The idea that house relationships are determined by the aspects that each house forms with every other house can be extended to all house relationships. And when one approaches derived house meanings in this way, the meanings that emerge are compatible with, and clearly related to, the intrinsic meanings described in </a><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="a">Chapter </a>14<span style=" color: #000;">. We do not have to resort to superficial interpretations, and neither do we acquire a tremendous array of additional meanings for each house that makes delineation hopelessly complicated. I believe that the traditional derived interpretations of houses that work do so because they are compatible with the principle of deriving house meanings from aspects.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part41.htm#bookmark203" class="s31">Below are some specific examples of how each aspect can relate a pair of houses. These meanings are derived from the aspect meanings presented in </a><a href="part41.htm#bookmark203" class="a">Chapter </a>7<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Opposition<span class="p">. Opposite houses create consciousness and understanding concerning each other’s issues. Each tends to counteract or</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">331</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">balance the excesses of the other, identifying what needs to be done whenever an issue associated with the other house threatens to dominate. The opposition has the quality of polarization, which can sometimes bring about conflict.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Examples: If one is self-centered (overdeveloped first house), a close relationship (seventh house) will help to correct this. A seventh-house relationship can also help bring out aspects of the personality (first house) that might otherwise stay hidden.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, an extreme fifth-house manifestation like doing whatever one wishes without considering others may be corrected by eleventh-house activities with friends and groups of people.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If one becomes too enslaved to one’s possessions (second house), one often encounters circumstances that force one to give them up (eighth house). This can take the form of house cleaning, taxes, or even death (the giving up of one’s goods and physical body). Except (as far as we know) for death, one often increases in awareness as a result.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark493">Becoming too preoccupied with everyday reality (third house) is corrected by ninth-house matters that pull one’s awareness out of that world into broader perceptions.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Likewise, becoming overly wrapped up in one’s intimate, personal circle (fourth house) is offset by tenth-house matters that draw one out into the greater world where one functions as an adult. But if one’s calling or career (tenth house) becomes too strong an issue, one can retire to one’s home and family environment (fourth house) to recoup one’s energies.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Trine<a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="s31">. Houses in trine indicate areas of life that are related in ways that are outlined in the “House Triplicities” section of </a><a href="part105.htm#bookmark439" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">13</span><span class="p">. Such houses reinforce each other, creating energy systems that interlock easily and which normally work together in a harmonious, or at least a consistent, way.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Examples: The so-called “personal houses” one, five, and nine are all areas where one releases one’s energy into the world. One’s general impact on one’s surroundings (first house) is aided and abetted by one’s self-expression (fifth house) and by roaming far and wide (ninth house). Or, one’s effectiveness in the world (first house) is enhanced by one’s ability to enjoy oneself (fifth house) and one’s ability to see the overall picture (ninth house).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Among the “practical houses,” the work activities and vocation signified by houses six and ten make possible the possessions signified by house two. Conversely, possessions such as tools make sixth-house work easier. Ideally, one’s daily job (sixth house) furthers one’s life purpose</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(tenth house). And the possessions one owns (second house) often determine or are determined by one’s social status (tenth house).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Among the “social houses,” the kind of relationship one has with one’s partner (seventh house) often blends into the kind of relationship one has with people in one’s everyday world (third house) and with friends (eleventh house). Although one’s actual friends may be in conflict with one’s partner or siblings, each house’s type of relating supplements that of the others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The hidden parts of the psyche symbolized by the “unconscious houses” also feed into and reinforce each other. One’s earliest home life and sense of being nurtured (fourth house) have much to do with the repressed energies that tend to be our undoing (twelfth house). Feelings about sex and death and giving our possessions up to others (eighth house) are another source of twelfth-house repression. And repression is often overcome in the course of psychological “death and resurrection.” Also, our sense of being nurtured and protected in early life (fourth house) has much to do with our feeling free to let go (eighth house) of possessions, ego, body, or whatever else makes us feel secure in adult life.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark494">Square</a><span class="p">. Houses in square indicate areas of life that test each other, forcing the issues associated with each to become more clearly defined and take on more definite meaning. Often a symbolic statement in the individual’s life will take on concrete form. There may be conflict between the two areas, but the conflict is necessary.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Examples: An infantile personality, reluctant to venture away from the nurturing atmosphere of home (fourth house), cannot make an effective impact (first house) on the world. One must grow up in order to deal with the world as a personality in one’s own right.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The tenth house, indicating fathering, tests one’s ability to deal with the world, as for instance when the parent tells the child how to behave. Or, one’s effective interaction with the outside world (first house) demands knowing what one’s goals are (tenth house). Or there may be a conflict between one’s personal expression (first) and one’s sense of duty to society (tenth).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A second-fifth square may signify a conflict between one’s attachments in the world and the pure self-expression of energy. For example, earning money may take up so much time that one has no time for pleasure; or one may spend so much time playing there is no time for earning a living.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">An eighth-eleventh square may signify the conflict between an eighth-house transformation of the self and eleventh-house social</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">involvements.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Sextile<span class="p">. Houses related by sextile represent activities that support each other, even though they are not as closely related as those signified by houses in trine. It takes slightly more effort and awareness to bring such activitites into a cooperative relationship.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Examples: Social involvements (eleventh house) are often useful to an individual in making an impact on the surrounding world (first house). Likewise, friends can usually count on one for help when necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first-third sextile works in a similar manner: for the eleventh house’s friends, substitute the third’s relatives and neighbors. Also, the third’s semiautomatic consciousness that deals with everyday surroundings liberates one’s mind to be more effective in dealing with others and putting energies out into the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Physical security (second house) is one of the things that makes emotional security (fourth house) more likely to happen. Or, one’s financial resources determine the quality of the place in which one lives. Or, one’s possessions are usually stored in one’s home.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Semisextile<span class="p">. This is a sometimes ambiguous relationship, in that the affairs of adjacent houses often seem totally unrelated and even antithetical. And yet each house is in some way completed by the house that follows it. This is especially true taking the odd-numbered houses as the first of each pair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark495">Examples: An activity pursued for its own sake (fifth house) must be supported by other activities that are pursued for the sake of something else (sixth house). One keeps the body in good shape for sports and other enjoyments (fifth house) by eating sensibly and doing exercises (sixth house), bathes and dresses (sixth) before going out on a date (fifth), or gains the money for a vaction (fifth) by working at a job (sixth).</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth and the tenth illustrate the way adjacent houses lead into one another and also the strain that occurs between them. Using the greater awareness of the external world gained in the ninth house, one can know how to make one’s way in the world more effectively in the tenth. But the ninth’s philosophical and idealistic tendencies can be difficult to reconcile with the tenth’s practical concerns.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quincunx<span class="p">. The quincunx relationship is similar to the semisextile, except that the ambiguity is greater and the extent to which the two houses make up a whole is less. Houses in quincunx often seem to restrict each other and to create a kind of negative equilibrium in which neither can operate effectively. Unlike the square, which forces a perhaps unpleasant but very useful testing and concretization of the affairs of the houses</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">involved, the quincunx may reach a point of stasis in which neither house is able to operate effectively and no progress is made. Only a tremendous increase in self-awareness can reveal the thread that unites the two houses. In order to render the relationship useful, this thread must be found.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Examples: The classic cases are the first-sixth and first-eighth quincunxes. If the first house is seen as one’s ability to make an impact on one’s surroundings, the sixth is the limitations necessity imposes on one’s freedom to do so, and the eighth is the letting-go of ego that threatens to disrupt one’s usual manner of confronting the world. It is easy to see how relations between these houses can reach an impasse. Limitations can constantly hinder without really stopping one, and the fear of letting go can actually lock one into ineffective ways of dealing with the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, if the first house is the physical body, then the sixth, as illness, limits the activities of the physical body while at the same time illness is an attempt to restore the body’s equilibrium. Unless insight is achieved, it is all too easy to become stuck in having chronic minor complaints, with the body somewhat limited and constantly trying to right itself. The body can also balk at a major transformation (eighth house) that would free it but at the same time destroy its established way of interacting with the environment.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using Aspect-Derived House Meanings in Delineation <span class="p">What I have been discussing here is not just abstract speculation: it also has a practical application, particularly in delineating empty houses.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Suppose we are examining someone’s one-to-one relationships, and the seventh house is empty, but there are several planets in the tenth. The seventh and the tenth are in mundane square. The horary approach would be to say that the tenth house, being the fourth from the seventh, refers to the home or family roots of the relationship. The loaded tenth house implies that from the viewpoint of the relationship there is a strong concern with finding a home or location where the relationship can take place. But experience has shown that a strong tenth house coupled with a weak seventh does not indicate a relationship looking for a home. Rather, it indicates a person whose relationships run afoul of a much more highly developed need to get out into the world, achieve something of importance in social terms, and find a rewarding career or life direction. These goals will be more important than finding a relationship that works. Or, if you look at the seventh house as non-marital partnerships (such as business partnerships), you will find that the heavy tenth indicates a person too concerned with his or her own achievements to be very good at the give-and-take of an equal partnership. You don’t need to use horary-type derived house meanings to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">335</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">deduce from a loaded tenth house something about every other house’s issues as well. This method works even when there are no planets in aspect between the houses in question.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To take another example, suppose you have a heavily populated eleventh house and an empty seventh. The eleventh and seventh houses are in mundane trine. This indicates that the issues of the two houses support each other, or at least interact in a regular, ongoing way that never causes crises in either of the houses. This suggests an easier time with one-to-one relationships. But instead of having a truly intimate quality, these relationships will always be more like friendships—less intense, and having less of the dialectical quality associated with the seventh. This is because the individual’s style of relating is set by the loaded eleventh house rather than the empty seventh.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Now suppose a pair of planets is in a trine that goes from the seventh to the tenth. In other words, there is a zodiacal trine involving houses that are in mundane square. This suggests that the person has a relatively easy time connecting intimate one-to-one relationships with career. At least the two areas are not experienced as unrelated or tensely related. Marriage or other partnerships may further the career, or the marriage may be made closer by common career interests with the partner. The trine is a smooth-flowing link, but its results are not necessarily constructive. The trine involving the seventh and tenth houses can also indicate someone who cannot keep a clear distinction between personal relationships and career.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark496">Let us reverse the pattern and look at houses that are in mundane trine containing planets that are in zodiacal square. Looking at the eleventh and seventh, we get an indication of a possible tension between group relationships and intimate, one-to-one relationships. This can take the negative form of friendships that disrupt marriage or partnerships, or it can force one to make clear distinctions between the demands and obligations of friends and those of one’s intimate partner. Unlike the trine, the square does require one to give concrete form to the energies that are in aspect. No looseness or vagueness is allowed; the issues of the two houses test each other. In this example, one is forced or at least obliged to put the two modes of relationship into separate compartments so that they do not overlap and therefore conflict.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mundane aspects between houses are the most useful when you are considering empty houses. When houses are occupied, I find that the zodiacal aspects between the planets tell more about the interaction of the houses involved. Whereas mundane aspects between houses show the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inherent relation between the issues of those houses, the zodiacal aspects of planets show how the inherent relation of the house issues is changed by the perspective of the individual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part124.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part126.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
