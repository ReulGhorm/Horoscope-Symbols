One is to use the so-called sidereal zodiac, which is a measure of a planet’s relation to the background of the fixed stars. The other is to use the so-called tropical zodiac, which is a measure of a planet’s relation to the point in the sky where the Sun is on the first day of spring. This point, known as the vernal equinox, or 0° Aries of the tropical zodiac, moves clockwise or backwards in the zodiac in relation to the fixed stars at the rate of about 1° every 72 years. About 2,000 years ago, the signs of the tropical zodiac lay in approximately the same part of the heavens as the constellations of the same name, but now 0° of tropical Aries has moved 24° to 25° back into the constellation of Pisces. This movement of the vernal point is called the precession of the equinoxes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark36">There are several reasons why I prefer to use the signs of the tropical zodiac rather than the constellations of the sidereal zodiac, which bear the same names but have different locations. For one thing, the tropical zodiac reflects the seasons of the year more clearly than does the sidereal zodiac. In the tropical zodiac, 0° Aries marks the beginning of spring, 0° Cancer the beginning of summer, 0° Libra the beginning of fall, and 0° Capricorn the beginning of winter. Thus the position of the Sun in the tropical signs is a clear indicator of the time of year. The seasons are phases in one of the most obvious astronomical cycles, and have a powerful effect on the Earth and its inhabitants.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another reason for using the tropical zodiac is that its beginning is a matter of clear-cut astronomical fact, whereas the beginning of the sidereal zodiac is a matter of debate. Tropical 0° Aries marks the intersection of two fundamental planes: the plane of the ecliptic, along which secondary motion takes place, and the plane of the equator, along which primary motion takes place. As defined above, the ecliptic is the plane of the Earth’s orbit around</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">28</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">the Sun, or, as seen from the Earth, the plane of the Sun’s apparent path through the fixed stars. The equator, on the other hand, is the plane of the Earth’s daily rotation on its axis. Tropical 0° Aries marks the beginning of the Sun’s yearly cycle: on the first day of spring, the Sun is directly overhead at the Earth’s equator, midway between its extreme north and south declinations. (Declination, the angular measure of a body’s distance north or south of the equator, is discussed more fully in the section on parallels at the end of </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="a">Chapter </a>6<span style=" color: #000;">.) On the first day of the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, the Sun reaches its northernmost declination. This is the summer solstice (from the Latin for “Sun standing”), when the Sun stops its northward progress. On the first day of fall the Sun is directly over the equator again, marking the autumnal equinox. And on the first day of winter the Sun reaches its southernmost declination, marking the winter solstice. This Sun-Earth cycle defines the four seasons, which in turn are each divided into three parts by the signs of the tropical zodiac.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The tropical signs thus express something very real about one of the main cyclical relationships of the Sun to the Earth. They are, however, not so clearly connected to the cycles of the other planets, which take either more or less than a year to complete a circuit of the zodiac, and which have orbital planes that cross the equator near, but not right at, 0° Aries. Nevertheless, the degrees of the tropical signs are used by most astrologers as the scale by which to measure the position along the ecliptic not only of the Sun, but of all factors in the chart. And most astrologers believe that each sign modifies in its own characteristic way the energies of all the planets and other points that fall within it.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Signs <span class="p">The signs of the tropical zodiac are the most familiar part of astrology. Even non-astrologers know “their sign,” which is the sign their Sun is in. This is because the Sun sign can be determined from the birthday alone without even knowing the year. The result is an excessive emphasis on zodiacal signs.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37">Popular texts attribute effects to signs that signs simply do not possess. For example, two people’s Sun signs will not be the principal determinant of whether or not they will get along. The Sun signs are only one relatively minor factor among many.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">An apt metaphor likens the signs to the colored glass in the rose window of a cathedral. The Sun shines through the glass and takes on different colors according to the part of the window it shines through. The signs have this effect on the planetary energies “shining” through them. As such, signs may assist or inhibit the easy expression of a planet’s energies, but they cannot fundamentally change the energies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">29</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Signs can symbolize behavioral quirks that give a person a great deal of individuality. But the mere fact that a planet is in a certain sign does not usually reveal an individual’s greatest strength or weakness, whereas combinations of that planet with another planet may do so. If planets can be likened to verbs, signs can be likened to adverbs.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="s31">Even though signs and planets do not signify the same kinds of thing, each planet has an affinity with certain signs, and works less well in other signs. This has given rise to the doctrine of rulerships. Rightly or wrongly, astrologers have developed a scheme whereby each planet “rules” a sign, and they have used this scheme to link a planet to a house when the sign the planet rules is on the house’s cusp. This procedure is discussed further at the end of </a><a href="part77.htm#bookmark316" class="a">Chapter </a>10<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part13.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part15.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
