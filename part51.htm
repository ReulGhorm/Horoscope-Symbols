This is using midpoints as a “fudge factor,” enabling one to get anything one wishes out of a chart. Such astrologers take midpoints out of the context of the entire chart, especially the entire midpoint structure, and exaggerate the importance of one or two midpoint combinations. If one uses midpoints at all, one should consider all of them, or at least all direct midpoints.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If we use ten planets, plus the lunar node, Ascendant, Midheaven, and 0° Aries Point, however, we have a total of ninety-one direct midpoints. And this does not count indirect midpoints, hard aspects to direct midpoints, which also are important enough to be considered. Clearly, just inserting all these midpoints in the conventional twelve-equal-wedges horoscope form that most astrologers in the English-speaking world use would result in a horrendous mess, and would get us nowhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The problem is, how do we handle this avalanche of detail? How do we find all these points without tedious calculations? And, once we find them, how do we pick the ones that are important?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part50.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part52.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
