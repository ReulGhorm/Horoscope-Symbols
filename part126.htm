Deferring to convention, in </a><a href="part111.htm#bookmark455" class="a">Chapter </a>14 <span style=" color: #000;">I discussed the houses in the usual counterclockwise order. Here, however, I will take a fresh look at them in the order that the planets actually move through them in the course of a day. This, I believe, will shed further light on the core meanings of the houses, helping to solve the mystery of where these meanings originated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">When you think about the direction the planets move in during the course of a day, rising in the east and setting in the west, counting the houses in a clockwise order seems quite plausible. If you will recall, at least one house system, the <i>oktotopos</i>, was in fact numbered in clockwise order. But the idea of looking at houses in this way does not often occcur to people, probably because the houses have become identified with the signs, which the planets transit in a mainly counterclockwise fashion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is not clear whether the twelve houses were originally intended to be related to the twelve signs, but at least in Ptolemy and other Greek writers no strong relationship exists between the meanings of the signs and the houses. Neither does there seem to be any strong connection in the Renaissance. Yet in modern times there has been an increasing identification of the houses with the signs, such, for example, that Aries and the first house are considered by many writers to be essentially the same, albeit on different levels. Some have extended this and considered the first house, the sign Aries, and the planet Mars (Aries’s ruler) to parallel each other in meaning.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But there are problems with this. Not only does the primary motion of the planets go in the opposite direction from the secondary motion, the high points of the two cycles are different. The Midheaven derives its meaning from the fact that the Sun is on the Midheaven at noon. This is the peak of the day cycle, when people are most active and involved with each other. The Midheaven’s association with fame, honor, and social standing comes from its association with the elevated position of the Sun.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark498">When we associate the signs with the houses, however, the Midheaven corresponds to the beginning of Capricorn. This is the winter</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">solstice, the time when, in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun reaches its lowest declination. This is the low point of the year, the time when all life is at an ebb. By the same token, the I.C., which is the location of the Sun at midnight, the bottom of the day cycle, would be connected to the summer solstice, the peak of the seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The symbolism is no better in the Southern Hemisphere. True enough, the beginning of Capricorn is the high point of the Southern Hemisphere’s seasonal cycle, making it analogous to noon, the high point of the day cycle. But spring in the Southern Hemisphere begins with Libra, which we associate with the seventh, not the first, house. Spring means that the Sun is crossing the equator and increasing in declination, whereas at the seventh-house cusp the Sun or other planets are crossing the horizon and decreasing in altitude.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some astrologers, such as those of the Uranian school, have tried to change this by making the Midheaven correspond to the beginning of Cancer, and the I.C. to the beginning of Capricorn. But then this makes the first house associated with Libra, not Aries. Again, as with the Southern Hemisphere example, an increase in altitude is linked to a decrease in declination.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Despite these differences, real similarities do of course exist between the signs and the houses. It is natural that two twelvefold divisions of cycles into phases would exhibit parallelisms. And in fact, day-for-a- year progressions are based on the idea of the parallelism of the day cycle and the year cycle. But we must not be blinded by thinking that the cycles are identical. By concentrating too much on their similarities, we tend to overlook the obvious astronomical fact that planetary motion within the houses is clockwise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In order to see how well house symbolism works in a clockwise order, let us first take one more look at the symbolism of the horoscope angles and hemispheres.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Two Poles of Being <span class="p">There appear to be two sources of energies that we experience as separate from our conscious being. The energies of both seem to cause events in our lives that appear to be beyond our control. The first and most obvious source is the outer world, the circumstances of which seem to shape our lives without any help from us. The other source is our inner depths. Likewise, the urges welling up from the unconscious seem to the conscious mind as if they come from an external source. In fact, in many cultures these urges have been attributed to gods or demons.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ultimately it is likely that, unawares, we are the source of both energies. But at the level at which we play the game of life, it seems as</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">338</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">though we are standing midway between the two poles, neither of which we feel is really a part of us. Our free will seems limited to an area in between, where the two sources of energy are nearly in equilibrium.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark499">This middle zone is represented in the horoscope by the horizon. The Earth is what we are standing on, and the horizon is the level at which we live. Hidden deep beneath us is the I.C., representing the inner pole of energies, and high overhead is the Midheaven, representing the outer pole.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">During the course of a day, every day, all the planets rise upward in a clockwise fashion from the I.C., past the Ascendant, to the Midheaven. And then they descend from the Midheaven, past the Descendant, back to the I.C.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, in the eastern hemisphere of the chart planetary energies are proceeding from the inner pole toward the outer. This hemisphere is primarily under the influence of the inner energies. It stands for action that is either our own or the product of our inner life, such as impulses and emotional drives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the chart’s western hemisphere, the energies are on their way from the outer pole toward the inner. Therefore the western hemisphere is under the influence of the outer energies. It stands for actions of others, our experience of the outer world, and the manner in which we incorporate this experience of the outer world into our inner being.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Four Quadrants <span class="p">We now have an inner and an outer pole of being, with the horizon marking the boundary between the inner and outer realms. The I.C.-Midheaven axis and the Ascendant-Descendant axis divide the horoscope into four quadrants, which we number clockwise from the</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I.C. Starting from the I.C. (instead of the Ascendant) is much like starting our day at midnight. This way we will see the upward sweep of energies from their most secret and private to their most public manifestation, and back down again. And the old symbolism of the fourth house suggests that the I.C. is a proper starting place. The fourth house is the womb, just prior to birth. It is also the tomb, and the end of the matter. Although I am starting at the I.C. rather than the Ascendant and proceeding clockwise, I will keep the usual house numbering to minimize confusion.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant I <span class="p">(houses three, two, and one) is a quadrant in the inward hemisphere dominated by energy flowing from the inner pole. It suggests one’s experience of the inward and personal dimensions of life as they are influenced by inner impulses.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant II <span class="p">(houses twelve, eleven, and ten) is an outer quadrant dominated by energy flowing from the inner pole. It indicates our personal action on, and incorporation into, the outer world.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">339</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant III <span class="p">(houses nine, eight, and seven) is an outer quadrant dominated by energy flowing from the outer pole. It indicates external energies coming toward us from outside, our experience of those energies, and those external aspects of our lives that seem not to be under our personal control or influence.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark500">Quadrant IV </a><span class="p">(houses six, five, and four) is an inner quadrant dominated by a flow from the outer pole. It suggests those aspects of our personal world that are most affected by external energies, and our incorporation of those energies into our inner being.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Subdividing the Quadrants <span class="p">Since the progress from one angle to the next is a continuum with no sharp boundaries, it is possible to divide the quadrants into any number of parts. So that an alien scheme does not become more alien, however, I will retain the subdivision of each quadrant into three parts. In this way you will have an indication of how the twelve conventional houses would derive their meanings from the clockwise movement of energies.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">From analyzing the houses, it appears that the logical threefold subdivision of each quadrant would be into the following phases:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">1. <i>Entry</i>, corresponding to the cadent houses. Crossing into a new quadrant, a planetary energy enters as an alien force which meets with resistance in the new realm. Its initial difficulties in adjusting produce a crisis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">This view of the cadent houses accounts for both their traditionally evil reputation and the fact that the Gauquelin research finds them to be strong. Having just emerged from the angle, the planetary energies are fresh and at the beginning of a cycle. But the resistance they meet often produces difficulties. It is also possible that the challenge of a crisis calls forth the full strength of a planetary energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Traditionally, houses twelve and six are considered much more difficult than houses three and nine, and I have observed this to be true. The reason for this becomes clear from the model I have proposed. While we are likely to experience the I.C. and Midheaven areas as being separate from our consciousness and will, the areas about the horizon are “where we live,” so to speak. Thus the shifts and discontinuities that occur here are more difficult for us to deal with. Looked at another way, the Ascendant and Descendant are those critical points where our inner being must confront the outer world. The change from one realm to another is a more difficult shift than the simple change of direction that happens at the Midheaven and I.C. Yet another explanation is that houses three and nine are in mundane sextile and trine to the Ascendant-Descendant axis, whereas houses six and twelve</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">340</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are in quincunx and semisextile to this vital axis of confronting the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">2. <i>Incorporation and fixation</i>, corresponding to the succedent houses. This is a phase of settling in. Planetary energies adjust and reach their point of maximum integration into the new quadrant. As they approach this point, they become stable and cease being the subject of major tensions. Being at a point of fixity, they have little impact, at least from the standpoint of the dynamic development of the personality. This may explain the Gauquelin findings that planets seem to manifest least strongly when in this part of the quadrants.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark501">3. </a><i>Preparation</i>, corresponding to the angular houses. Planetary energies now prepare to enter a new quadrant and a new crisis stage, and are busy laying foundations for the changeover. Following the stillness of the incorporation phase, planetary energies are beginning to become active again. But they have not yet reached the pitch of activity that they will reach in the crisis phase. This seems to correlate with the sharp upward swing planetary strength seems to take in the Gauquelin findings as the planets approach the angles from the angular houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The signs and other planets encountered in the preparation phase determine whether the energy will enter the next quadrant with ease or difficulty.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Dynamics of the Quadrants <span class="p">We are now ready to look at the succession of the houses in the quadrants. As you will see, though the conventional counterclockwise scheme was presented first for the sake of familiarity, the clockwise scheme has in fact been the origin of many of the observations made in this book. The meanings we come up with when looking at the houses clockwise will be much like the meanings already stated, but now their origin should be clearer. Even with the houses viewed clockwise, we still have the operation of each on an internal, relational, and external level.</span></h4><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant I<span class="p">. In the first quadrant, the flow from the inner pole begins to impinge on consciousness. In general, we experience this flow as impulses, compulsions, and desires that we do or do not wish to have.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the third house, the flow from the inner pole programs and structures the awareness with which we deal with everyday reality. The third house is our experience of and reaction to psychic energy as it flows from our innermost patterns of thinking. At the external level, this affects our speech, communications, and everyday dealings with the world. We do not normally experience this energy as critical except that we are usually somewhat out of control of what we are doing, and this can cause difficulties when the patterns are inappropriate. How many of us are really</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">341</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">aware of our innermost mental programing and the ways it affects our innermost mental processes? We can become aware of it, but we are not usually so.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the second house, the flow from the inner is stabilized. As in all the middle trisections or succedent houses, this stabilization, fixation, and incorporation process consists of becoming attached to something. In the second house the issue is attachment itself. To feel secure, we build structures within ourselves to prepare for launching ourselves into the outer world. On the external level, this manifests as attaching ourselves to possessions, which make us feel more secure, effective, independent, and capable of dealing with what we will encounter.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark502">In the first house, we gather our inner energies in order to make an impact on the outer world at the Ascendant. Consequently, this is the house that most affects how others see our energies. Thus the first house describes our personality, in the sense of the face that we present to the outside world.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It seems to me that the meaning of the first house becomes much clearer when viewed in a clockwise framework. Going counterclockwise from the first, we are moving toward the inward pole, but going clockwise we are moving toward the outer, more public area of life. It is toward the public area of life that the personality is directed.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant II<span class="p">. The energy now crosses the Ascendant. The flow from the inner that seemed slightly alien in the third house is now completely ours as it crosses into the upper hemisphere. This quadrant represents inner energy with which we attempt to act upon the world.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The twelfth house is one of the most important houses in the chart. It is here that our inner energies meet their first challenge as they encounter the outer world. Because these energies are raw and untried, the encounter is often unsuccessful.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eleventh house is another area of stabilization, fixation, and incorporation. As in every other middle trisection, a feeling of separateness disappears. In the twelfth we felt that the outer world resisted us, but this feeling vanishes in the eleventh. Here our inner energy establishes itself and becomes integrated into the outer world. The eleventh is thus the area in which we integrate ourselves into groups. Whereas the second house represented attachment to possessions, the eleventh represents attachment to our niche in society.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In some schools of Hindu astrology, the eleventh house relates to the way one gets money, whereas the second only relates to the way one deals with the money one already has. This fits well into our scheme because getting money involves the way we present ourselves to and act upon the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">outside world. The second house does not at its deepest level mean having money; it symbolizes the way we attach ourselves to entities in our personal lives. The eleventh is the process of making the attachment to something external or social. Money always comes from outside sources.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In both the clockwise and counterclockwise schemes, the second house (having money) precedes the eleventh (getting it in the first place), so that the effect appears to precede the cause. This is not a problem, however, when you remember that though we can speak of energy beginning at one or the other poles, we are actually talking about motion around a wheel, which has no beginning or end. Energy does not merely move from pole to pole, it is carried around the wheel completely, again and again. Our experiences (the western half of the chart) are the consequence of our actions (eastern half), and vice versa. Our inner lives arise from our outer circumstances, and our outer circumstances arise from our inner lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The tenth house is the phase when planetary energy reaches its outermost projection. This can manifest as career, calling, or the way we transcend ourselves. Here we can show the way to others who follow us, which is why this house represents the fatherly aspect of parenting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark503">As with the other houses, the tenth does not always work at the external level. Contrary to what many astrologers believe, a populated tenth house does not necessarily mean an individual concerned with social status or being in the public eye. People with a strong tenth house may instead choose to manifest its internal or relational level. They may be retiring in a social sense but choose to be guide figures to those in their personal world. Such people may be teachers either professionally or informally.</a></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Quadrant III<span class="p">. Crossing the Midheaven, we shift from an area primarily concerned with the action of the inner upon the outer to an area where the outer is the primary source of energy. But, as mentioned above, energy also comes over from the other side, manifesting as our experience of things in the outer world that arise as a consequence of our own actions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Just as in the third house energy from the inner pole imprinted our inner consciousness, in the ninth energy from the outer pole imprints our outer consciousness. Being above the horizon here, we are dealing with a much more conscious type of thought. So the ninth house symbolizes our ability to see energies coming into our lives from far off, long before these energies can affect us intimately. In the ninth we have the perspective for seeing the big picture and the patterns that integrate things.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">These energies often seem strange and alien because they originate so far from our intimate lives. We need to strain to adjust our consciousness to comprehend what we see. This may require an expansion of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">consciousness, or leaving familiar environments for ones distant from our own. This is why the ninth is associated with long-distance travel and whatever is foreign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eighth house is another area of fixation, stabilization, and incorporation. The energies of the outer were in the ninth house in many ways too distant and too newly entered into our lives to affect us except at the level of expanding consciousness. In the eighth house these energies consolidate and begin to attach themselves in our world so that they can become effective with respect to ourselves. Here we have the eighth house as the opposite of the second. On the external level, eighth-house attachments are property and physical resources, but those of other people, not our own. On the internal level, the eighth house signifies the way the outer world attaches itself to us, pulling us away from those personal concerns and attachments that limit us. Thus it allows, if not forces, us to grow. This leads to the ideas of transformation and death. In terms of the clockwise scheme, the eighth house pulls us away from our own attachment structure toward something external and sometimes higher than our own personal, intimate levels of being.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark504">The seventh house signifies the energy of the outer preparing to enter the personal, inner world. The outer energy becomes as intimate as it can be while not yet within us. Thus the seventh house represents our experience of the intimate other, our polar complement in the outer world. This can mean a personal enemy as well as a lover.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Seen in this light, the seventh house also signifies what we perceive as the “personality” of the outer world, what we expect from other people, especially those close to us. This is the obvious polar counterpart to the first house as personality. But just as the first house is our expression of the self on an intimate level with respect to others, so the seventh house is usually our experience of others on an intimate level.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Quadrant IV<span class="p">. As the energy crosses the horizon, there is another</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">crisis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The sixth house has always been considered difficult because as the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">energies of the outer come into the inner hemisphere, the inner resists them. We strive to take in and assimilate the energy of the outer in this house, but just as the inner energy was a stranger in the twelfth, the outer energy is a stranger in the sixth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The sixth is a house of health because our health depends so much on how we react to what we take in. Psychosomatic illness often results from taking in at the psychological level energies that we cannot handle. We then experience on the physical level a symbol of our rejection of that energy.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">On the psychological level, in the sixth house we experience our personal lives shaped by externally imposed energies. Our wills can feel constrained by the externally imposed limitations of work, duty, and responsibility. Yet as with the twelfth, if we overcome the limitations we experience in the sixth, we can make the energies work to our own ends. This is why the area relates not only to our work for others, but also to others who work for us.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In the sixth house, the external energies are experienced as alien and intrusive. There is still an awareness of separation between our inner lives and the externally derived energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fifth house, however, completes the assimilation. The energy of the outer is integrated into the inner, just as in the eleventh the inner energies are integrated into the outer. In the fifth house we are no longer aware of resistance to the outer energy. What we have experienced is now our own. We can stop fighting it and use it. This and the fact that the fifth house is in mundane trine to the first makes us experience the fifth as a house of self- release. Our working with the energies of the outer is no longer work, that is, activity directed by an externally imposed necessity. Now it is the expression, within the inner part of the self, of energies that were originally derived from the outer part of the self. (Keep in mind that we are never really talking about energies that are truly external, but rather about energies that are experienced as external.) This is why, while the fifth symbolizes play in both the highest and most trivial aspects of the word, the games played here are usually played with, and invented with the aid of, others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark505">I mentioned in the previous chapter’s discussion of the fifth that having children is an activity pursued for its own sake, that there is often no special purpose served by having children. Yet looking at the reasons most people have children, it seems as if a deeply internal drive to procreate originates in social necessity. Fifth-house activities are often spontaneous personal expressions of drives that began in the outer pole.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fourth house is where the energy of the outer makes its deepest intrusion into the inner and becomes part of the most private famework of the individual. The fourth house symbolizes one’s experience of the womb, nurture, and one’s infantile support system, but all these come ultimately from the outer pole. To complete the idea of the dialectic between outer and inner, what we are inwardly is to a great extent what we were given by those who preceded us in the outer world. And what we experience is the result of what we put out into the world. The cycle of energy is continuous. There is no real distinction between the energies of the inner and the outer, except what comes from the splitting of our experience. The end of the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">matter is the beginning.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Starting at the I.C. and going clockwise around the chart, the fourth house is the last. Even as we were born out of the Earth, our ultimate mother, in death we return to her. In the course of life, we go from dust to dust, or from the Earth (the I.C.) to the Earth—only, presumably, to begin the cycle again.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship between the Two Views of the Houses <span class="p">I feel that the clockwise model is the better one from which to derive the significations of the houses. Yet I am aware that there are years of tradition and practice working against its general acceptance. I am also not convinced that the counterclockwise model is totally invalid, as the planets do go through the houses both clockwise in their primary motion and mostly counterclockwise in their secondary or zodiacal motion. It is thus inevitable that coherent patterns of cyclical change would emerge looking at the cycles in either direction.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I think we will get the best results if we suspend our prejudices and look at the houses both ways. This will help us better to understand the core meanings of the houses, and will liberate us from the superifical understanding of them that we may have had in the past.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">For those who are completely closed to this bi-directional approach, I would like to point out that the signs are also bi-directional. The Moon’s nodes, at least, transit the signs in reverse order, clockwise. We could easily derive a clockwise model for the sign cycle that would give us new insights into the signs and their symbolism. In fact, Carl Payne Tobey has already done so in his book <i>Astrology of Inner Space</i>. But a clockwise discussion of the signs is not so essential. I have treated the clockwise interpretation of the houses here because, contrary to the general perception, the more significant motion of the planets through the houses happens to be clockwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part125.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part127.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
