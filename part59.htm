Note that instead of being divided into 360° this dial is divided into 90°. Since there are only one-quarter as many degrees, the degrees are four times as large; hence the greater accuracy possible. There is room for each degree to be marked off in subdivisions of 5’ of arc, with longer lines for the 15’ and 30’ subdivisions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The feathered arrow at the top represents 0° Aries, and the zodiac continues around counterclockwise from this pointer. Groups of 5° are marked off by alternating black and white areas on the inner ring. One- quarter of the way around is a large dot marking off 22.5°; one-third of the way around is a line going to the center and marking off 30°; one-half of the way around is an arrow without feathers that marks off 45°; two-thirds of the way around is another line going to the center and this time marking off 60°. And so on, to the feathered arrow at the top, which this time around represents 90°.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Note also that there are only three signs shown on the dial. The first third is marked with the glyph for Aries, the second third with Taurus, and the third third with Gemini. This is just shorthand for saying that all the cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn) will fall into the first third of the 90° dial; all the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius) will fall into the second third; and all the mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) will fall into the third third.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">What the 90° dial does is divide the zodiac into four pieces—the first from 0° Aries to 29°59’59” Gemini; the second from 0° Cancer to 29°59’59” Virgo; the third from 0° Libra to 29°59’59” Sagittarius; and the fourth from 0° Capricorn to 29°59’59” Pisces—and then place all four pieces on top of one another. This is why two planets in square (say, from 7° Aries to 7° Cancer) or in opposition (7° Aries to 7° Libra) will in the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">90° chart look as if they are in conjunction: Cancer and Libra (and Capricorn) have been placed right on top of Aries.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark259">For similar reasons, all semisquares and sesquiquadrates look like oppositions. These are easy to see because if the feathered arrow is on a certain planet, the planet in semisquare or sesquiquadrate will always be at the unfeathered arrow opposite. Likewise (though this is not as important in midpoint work), all aspects that are 30° multiples—the trine, sextile, semisextile, and quincunx—will on the 90° dial look like trines. These can be seen fairly easily because if the feathered arrow is on one planet, the planet in a 30° multiple aspect will be at one of the two other lines extending to the center of the dial.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 313pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="412" height="417" alt="image" src="Image_044.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark260">Figure 23.

Hold the dial down to keep it from turning, and with your ruler draw a longish line at the feathered arrow. Mark the line with the glyph for Aries. This will represent not only 0° Aries, but 0° of all the cardinal signs. Also go one-third of the way counterclockwise to the next line that extends to the center, and draw a line there marked with</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the glyph for Taurus. And go one-third of the circle further to the other line that extends to the center, and draw a line there marked with the glyph for Gemini.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">You are now ready to draw in the lines indicating the positions of the planets, lunar node, Ascendant, and Midheaven (I do not usually put intermediate house cusps in on the 90° chart). It is easiest to take the positions in zodiacal order, starting with the Aries positions, then the Taurus, etc. When you get to Cancer, you are back at the 0° cardinal point and you start going around the 90° dial all over again. Then go through all the positions again beginning with Aries to check whether the lines are at the right degrees and also to draw in the glyphs for the planets. You can mark the Ascendant with “A” and Midheaven with “M.” It is not necessary to enter the degree and minute of each position on the 90° chart, but if you indicate what sign each factor is in it will make it easier to distinguish conjunctions from squares and oppositions.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part59.htm#bookmark260" class="s31">To see how the 360° chart translates to the 90° chart, compare </a><a href="part59.htm#bookmark260" class="a">Figure </a>23 <a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="s31">with </a><a href="part58.htm#bookmark257" class="a">Figure </a>22<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using the 90° Dial to Find Midpoints <a href="part60.htm#bookmark263" class="s31">Let us look again at Bob Dylan’s Sun/Moon midpoint (the feathered arrow in </a><a href="part60.htm#bookmark263" class="a">Figure </a><span class="s24">24</span><span class="p">). Finding it is similar to finding it with the 360° dial: you merely locate the Sun and Moon and turn the dial so the feathered pointer is halfway between them. The only difference is in what information we get from doing this. We see much more clearly how exact the combinations are, and are thus better able to judge orbs. Also, not only do we see all the direct midpoints (Sun/Moon = Uranus=Jupiter/Uranus = Sun/Saturn), with the 90° dial we also see all the indirect midpoints (Sun/Moon=Mercury/Pluto=Mars/Saturn) as well, this time by looking at only one axis (because the four axes of the 360° dial are now all on top of each other).</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In order to distinguish the direct from the indirect midpoints (and to determine whether to allow a 1.5° or a 1° orb) you would need to refer back to the 360° chart. This is why it helps first to investigate the direct midpoints using the 360° dial. Then with the 90° dial you can add the indirect midpoints.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using the 90° dial tempts one to make no distinction between direct and indirect midpoints, or between major and minor hard aspects, which is what many Cosmobiologists do. As I said, however, I like to allow a smaller orb for indirect midpoints and also to give them less weight in my judgments. Although the 90° dial is a valuable tool, not only for seeing hard aspects at a glance, but also for timing transits and directions to the fraction</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of a degree, I find I must rely equally on the 360° chart or on listings such as I will now describe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part58.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part60.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
