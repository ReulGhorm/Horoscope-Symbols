As you will recall, Aries through Cancer related to the development of the individual as an individual, and Leo through Scorpio related to the development of the individual vis-a-vis other people, where these others were personally related to the individual in question.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The last four signs describe the individual’s integration into society as a whole. Society is understood on a much more abstract level than with the second group of four signs. The individual relates not only to those who are known, but also to the fabric of the social order itself, which cannot always be experienced personally.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The key idea of Sagittarius is the individual encountering a social context and learning to understand it and to express his or her will in it. Sagittarius is the most advanced of the fire signs, in that the expression of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">will must now transcend purely personal self-expression. Yet being the first of the four social signs, Sagittarius is the most ambivalent in its relationship to the social order. It values personal freedom and self-expression as highly as any other fire sign, and therefore it may have trouble adjusting to the restrictions of the larger social order. Yet the sign is unable to escape the knowledge of its relationship to society, and so it seeks a social role that allows it maximum self-expression while it is doing something socially useful. This sign is associated with idealism, with those who cannot accept the status quo and who would thus reform society. Yet, ambivalent as this sign is, it also symbolizes those who act as spokesmen for the social order and keep it whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In either case, the relationship of the individual to society is rather abstract. This sign is more concerned about principles and general patterns than it is about the details of implementation. Recall the relationship of Aries to Taurus, in which Aries operates as the abstract, unembodied will which receives its physical body in Taurus, the earth sign. Only by encountering the principle of earth can the will of Aries be made manifest. Similarly, Sagittarius states the principles of social cohesion even while being ambivalent about its relationship to society, and then Capricorn looks for ways to implement those principles.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like two other mutable signs, Sagittarius was often called a dual sign in the older literature. Whereas duality is not an especially fruitful notion for explaining Gemini or Pisces, it is more so with Sagittarius. Sagittarius feels ambivalent about its placement in the zodiacal scheme, and thus there are two distinct types of Sagittarian. (Old books associated these types with the first and second halves of the sign, but I have not found this to be reliable.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The first type is a classic freedom-loving fire-sign personality. It craves room in which to move and freedom with which to express itself. It is usually exuberant and likable but is not entirely reliable in keeping agreements. Nor is it especially consistent: it is extremely mutable. Even though this sign is well beyond Libra, it is reluctant to tie itself down in relationships, not because it prefers being alone, but because it wishes to be free to relate to whomever, wherever, without limits being imposed by social convention. This type is happy to encounter new experiences and is not especially tradition-bound.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark384">The second type of Sagittarian has achieved a successful integration into the social order and is concerned with the fabric of that order. This type has a need to study everything about the world in order to relate each part to every other part. Thus it is likely to be attracted to the sciences, philosophy,</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">religion, or any other discipline that reveals the interconnectedness of all things. This type is concerned about wisdom, which it prefers to mere knowledge: an idea is good only insofar as it aids in understanding the world so that one can live in it more effectively. But (and this is true of both kinds of Sagittarian) such ideas may still be abstract. Neither type enjoys grappling with the details of implementing what it understands, but the latter type is more willing to do so. Although this type is also very mutable in that it will adapt to adversity or challenge rather than fight it, it is much more consistent than the other.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Both types enjoy travel, which they see as both consciousness- enlarging and liberating from the constraints of everyday life. Both types are also idealists, but the second is more easily able to separate the real from the ideal.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There is no way of telling from the horoscope which type one is dealing with, because the two types are actually phases in the development of a single type. The first kind of Sagittarian is likely to evolve into the second if environmental influences permit. A strong Saturn may cause the first type to change into the second earlier in life.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Sagittarius to Jupiter <span class="p">What is true of Jupiter is often true of Sagittarius. Both are concerned with social integration, with the holistic viewpoint, with law, philosophy, and religion. Both symbolize the reaching-out of the individual to encounter the larger world.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">But there are differences: Sagittarius is much more changeable than Jupiter, more freedom-loving and irresponsible. Sagittarius is less likely to symbolize the acquisition of material goods. Also, being a sign and therefore a less powerful symbol than a planet, it is less likely than Jupiter to operate at an excessive level. Sagittarius is less likely to signify waste, excess, or arrogance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One other important difference is that Jupiter has a much stronger nurturing and protecting aspect than Sagittarius. Sagittarius, a fire sign, is too concerned with individual freedom and self-expression to be really happy taking on the responsibility of caring for and protecting another individual.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Sagittarius on Planets <span class="p">Planets in Sagittarius increase the general quantity of mutability and fire in a chart, and indicate a desire for freedom. Sagittarius gets along best with planets like Mars, Uranus, and the Sun, which are fast-moving, energetic, and not resistant to change. Mercury, which is traditionally in detriment in Sagittarius, does not seem to be all that bad there, its main difficulty being that it loses the ability</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to operate with precision and to deal with detail.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Obviously Sagittarius is somewhat incompatible with Saturn. The effect is to make Saturn try to concern itself with broad, sweeping ideas while still coming from Saturn’s extremely detailed approach. But this is not a serious problem unless Saturn is very prominent in the chart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark385">Planets that have a strong emotional component may not be difficult in Sagittarius, but they do not operate entirely true to their nature. Venus, for example, is reluctant to form binding relationships. It is not uninterested in sex, but it tends to prefer friendship to a more conventional sexual tie. The Moon operates well enough, but not much like a Moon: for example, there is not as much liking for tradition and being in touch with one’s roots.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Neptune, which is in Sagittarius as of this writing (1980), has stimulated the idealistic side of the sign beyond all bounds. Almost exactly coincident with its arrival in Sagittarius in 1970 there began the flowering of gurus and cults that has characterized the decade.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part94.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part96.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
