Philosophy, religion, the law. Long journeys<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth house is best understood as being opposite the third. As we saw, the third house symbolizes the part of the mind that deals with routine, day-to-day affairs. Though capable of being conscious, these mental functions usually go on at an unconscious level.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In contrast, the ninth house symbolizes those mental functions that reach out to deal with whatever is not routine or day-to-day. It is the house through which come new ideas, perceptions, and modes of thinking: a house of consciousness expansion. In order to be effective, these processes must function on a conscious level. Whenever one is consciously aware of thinking about something, this belongs to the ninth house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth-house style of perception is not only conscious, it is synthetic rather than analytic. It strives to perceive what relates parts to a whole and what pattern organizes any group of entities. It is not satisfied with simply perceiving a fact: it is equally concerned with meaning. It is very much concerned with what is “out there,” but it is concerned with the relationship of the self to what is “out there” as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth house symbolizes religion, philosophy, and the law because all these are concerned not only with the patterns that relate things in the external universe, but also with how the individual fits in with these patterns. Religion deals with what binds humankind in a relationship to the universe. Philosophies, at least older ones, describe the organization of the universe on moral and ethical as well as natural grounds. The law is a study of the social contract by which human beings govern their relations with each other.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth house has a strong social element, in that external factors or other people are often the source of new ideas. But it is not a house of relationships in the conventional sense of the word: one does not look there to find out how someone relates to others except in the most indirect manner. Rather it is a house that deals with the understanding of how things are integrated into systems. It is the house-level counterpart of Jupiter. Although it lacks the freedom-loving aspect of Jupiter, it shares Jupiter’s concern with truth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth house is traditionally associated with long journeys, as opposed to the short journeys of the third. Long journeys place one in an unfamiliar situation and hence expand ones consciousness. As stated in the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">discussion of the third house, the essential difference between third- and ninth-house journeys is not the length of the trip, but the degree to which the journey carries one out of the normal, everyday environment. It is probable that the original distinction between third- and ninth-house journeys arose in an era when traveling any distance at all inevitably meant entering an unfamiliar world. Even adjacent counties were often very different. But today it is possible to travel thousands of miles without leaving a homogeneous world-wide industrial culture.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">At their best, ninth-house energies bring foresight. Reaching out to see into the distance far beyond the ordinary concerns of the individual, these energies can detect in advance what may be coming in from the outer world. This enables one to avoid being caught by surprise when events come near enough to concern one’s intimate, everyday life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Even though the ninth is an outward-directed, above-the-horizon house, these same energies may sometimes go within in an attempt to understand the self. From the viewpoint of normal consciousness, one’s inner being may be as alien as the outer world far away from ordinary experience. Unless ninth-house planet and sign energies permit otherwise, however, the understanding gained by the inward questioning of this house may be purely intellectual. Various planetary functions need to translate ninth-house insights into the gut-level understanding necessary to make such information useful.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The ninth is commonly considered the house of higher education, and the third the house of elementary and high school. This is not necessarily true. Insofar as it operates to expand the awareness of an individual, all education is ninth-house in nature. Insofar as education serves only to impose discipline on an individual and inculcate the mores of the society without expanding the individual’s awareness of truth, it is not ninth-house. It is then a mixture of tenth-house (disciplining), sixth-house (work), fourth- house (babysitting), and third-house (programing) functions. This illustrates the principle that houses do not signify anything in the actual world at all: they only signify functions that the individual may experience, and relationships to the individual of things perceived in the outer world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Though it may be plausible to look at the ninth as the house of intelligence in the sense of I.Q., it is not safe to do so. I.Q. is a measure of ability to perform on I.Q. tests. Although it may correlate with academic success, it does not necessarily show ability to succeed in the world. Real intelligence probably has more to do with creating, innovating, and fathoming one’s own life. Because we do not really understand “intelligence,” I suggest not assigning this term to the ninth house. I prefer</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">instead to call it <i>a </i>house, not <i>the </i>house, of wisdom. Wisdom I see as knowing what is true for oneself and the world and operating so as to give everything its due and no more. The wise are not constantly overwhelmed by inner signals urging them to actions that are inappropriate as judged by the results.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Internal Level </b>The ninth and tenth are the two houses most connected with the conscious mind. But whereas the tenth has to do with the conscious mind acting upon the world, the ninth symbolizes the conscious mind experiencing, perceiving, and understanding what it perceives. While not primarily concerned with action, the ninth is not entirely passive, either: its energies make one want to <i>reach out </i>to perceive the greater world around one. Assuming that the planets and signs connected to this house do not oppose such a reaching-out, there is a desire to experience as much as possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As a house of active experiencing, the ninth is the home of those psychological patterns that modify and influence one’s perceptions. People do not passively observe the world; the structure of their consciousness influences how and what they perceive. Through ninth-house energies one builds a framework by which to organize experience: a philosophy, a world-view, even a reality system.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">On the inner-outer level we have the individual actually looking out into the world. Here the ninth house symbolizes the kinds of experiences one uses to shape one’s views of reality. Among such experiences might be consciousness-expanding travel as we have characterized it above.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark479">External Level </a><span class="p">At the outermost level the ninth house signifies all entities that seem remote from everyday experience: foreign countries, philosophies, religions, and ways of life; or people with a foreign background or a lifestyle and viewpoints that are very different from one’s own. At this level the ninth also symbolizes teachers, in the sense of gurus more than disciplinarians. Here is an excellent example of the external level of a house manifestation being always a projection of internal-level energies: ultimately, one’s guru is nothing more or less than the external experiencing of an energy within.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Ninth House <span class="p">Having many planets in the ninth is a strong sign of being unwilling to accept the limits of the everyday world in which one was brought up. Such people will always reach out to experience the new and unfamiliar, to find out more about the world and what is true.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They are often interested in consciousness-expanding disciplines like religion, philosophy, and the law, or in traveling widely on the physical rather than the mental plane.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Ninth-house planets affect one’s philosophy of life and how one deals with ideas. For example, a ninth-house Uranus indicates someone who is comfortable with new and radical ideas and who tends to reject the traditional. Neptune in the ninth can indicate someone attracted to religious and spiritual concepts and perceptions, as well as possibly someone whose philosophy of life is unclear. Saturn in the ninth might indicate an individual whose ideas are definite, fixed, and of a practical nature. Venus might indicate someone whose ideas are influenced by aesthetics more than logic. Each planet in turn can stamp its own energy on the individual’s style of thinking about the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part119.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part121.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
