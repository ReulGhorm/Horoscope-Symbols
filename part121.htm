One’s social status, honor or reputation. One’s father or mother. People in power over one, such as bosses, employers, or government officials<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It is plain from the above list that the tenth is an external house, a house of the individual being very much out in the world. This is one side of the tenth; the other is that, like all the houses from seven through twelve, the tenth is best understood in terms of its opposite house. The tenth symbolizes those energies that counterbalance the fourth house and draw one away from its concerns.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">As we saw, the fourth symbolizes one’s most personal world, the background from which one comes, the place to which one withdraws, and one’s early experience of nurture. Throughout life, the fourth symbolizes all in the individual that is most inward and farthest from the outer world. This includes the unconscious mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The tenth, on the other hand, symbolizes the individual going out into the world, those persons who guide the individual in doing so, and those aspects of the mind that most deal with the external world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In order for one to develop from an infant into an adult who plays a role in the social universe, there have to be energies that draw the individual out of the womb and the childhood home, bringing about an increasing interaction in the outer world. These are tenth-house energies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In childhood these energies are experienced through the parents as they discipline the child, support its efforts to grow, and teach it how to get</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">along in the outer world. While both parents do this to some extent, the tenth house usually symbolizes the person (parent or otherwise) who most played this role. In my experience the tenth is a house of fathering, but this is not always related to one’s biological father.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Those whom one experiences as tenth-house figures in early life are, of course, authority figures, and one’s experience of them sets the pattern for all experience of authority figures later on. This is the basis for the tenth house signifying people in authority over one and even one’s relationship to the government as a whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Tenth-house figures also help one find goals in life: something to become, a role to play. Whereas the fourth signifies a state of being that is fundamentally satisfied with itself, the tenth often signifies a state to which one aspires but has not yet attained. Thus the theme of dissatisfaction with wherever one may be in life is inherent in tenth-house symbolism. Similarly, whereas the fourth is a house in which one merely exists without having to prove oneself, the tenth is strongly associated with the idea of performance, of doing, and of playing a role by which one may be identified.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">People usually reply to “What are you?” by describing what they do for a living. Out of this comes the association of the tenth house with one’s career or profession. This is not sixth-house work, which one does simply to earn a living, but work that provides a social role, work that one can identify with and by which one is identified.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">If ones job does not provide this sense of identity, some other area of life may. For example, one might be a post-office clerk for a living and a nationally known stamp collector for a hobby. If stamp collecting provides a sense of identity and one is primarily known for it, then it, not post-office work, is the tenth-house activity.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">From the above it should be evident why the tenth signifies one’s social status, honor, and reputation. In fact, older astrology put more emphasis on the tenth as an index of social status than as a determiner of career.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Implicit in this, but not covered in extant literature concerning the tenth, is something I have found extremely important. The tenth house can be the key to understanding one’s self-transcendence: that is, in what direction one must evolve until one is living out the symbolism of ones horoscope at the highest, most conscious level, with all the various energies within the self integrated with each other to the highest possible degree.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Why should this be so? It is in the nature of one’s evolutionary pattern to grow into an interaction with the world outside oneself. This is the game of being incarnate in the physical universe. From the womb one</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">moves out into the home and family, the school, the world, and then into a social role of one’s own, and it does not need to stop there. Why should not these same tenth-house energies, given reinforcement from one’s surroundings, lead one to worlds beyond the social universe? If the Earth is the womb of physical existence, and the tenth house symbolizes energies that draw us out of the womb, then the tenth would logically symbolize energies that guide us into transcendental understanding as well. Whereas the ninth symbolizes the guru within who leads us to reach out and understand more, the tenth symbolizes our reaching for a role to play in the world to which the guru leads us. The tenth can be a calling beyond the mere calling of how we make a living.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In practical terms, of course, the tenth house is usually limited to roles in the social universe. But I find that, looking at the symbolism of the tenth house from a metaphysical viewpoint, one can get valid data about how an individual can grow on the spiritual as well as the mental plane. At the very least, the tenth can guide one toward making one’s life work more effective and rewarding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like other houses that signify one’s experience of another individual playing a role, the tenth house also signifies how one plays tenth-house roles for others: how one will serve as a guide, authority, or disciplinary figure. As mentioned in connection with the fifth house, the tenth used to be one of the four houses signifying children. Even as the tenth signifies one’s own experience of whoever played the father role, so it can also indicate one’s own ability to play the role of father in relation to one’s children. (Again, keep in mind that either parent can play the father role at various times.)</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">Even at the internal level, the tenth house does not operate in a vacuum totally apart from other people. In its concern with answering the questions “Who am I?,” “What am I?,” “What am I doing?,” and “Where am I going?” it normally requires a social setting in order to arrive at its definitions of the self.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Whereas the ninth house symbolizes the greatest possible consciousness of the not-self, the tenth represents the greatest possible consciousness of the self. And while the ninth symbolizes the conscious mind reaching out to <i>experience </i>the external world, the tenth represents the conscious mind reaching out to <i>act </i>in the external world, to be an agent and play a role.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark481">The tenth house at this level can also indicate the internalization of energies that were originally external. For example, we mentioned above that the tenth can indicate one’s ability to play the father or guide-figure role toward another, especially a child. This results from one’s internalizing</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">316</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">one’s own experience of fathering: the father figure, whoever it may have been, becomes an aspect of one’s own mind. From this level comes the Freudian superego, which roughly corresponds to the conscience, the internal arbiter that decides between right and wrong.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">The tenth house signifies all relationships between oneself and another in which there is inequality: where one person plays a dominant role to the other, who explicitly or implicitly takes the role of a child or dependent. The essence of such a relationship is that the person taking the dominant role teaches or guides the other. The inequality inherent in these relationships is usually normal and proper rather than pathological. The superior knowledge of the guide figure and the guidance being given are useful and necessary to the one receiving them.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At the external level is one’s experience of those who act as guide figures, disciplinarians, authority figures, or people in power over one like bosses, employers, and government officials. The way one experiences these people is related to the way one experienced fathering in early life. Certain planetary indications can suggest that one may react strongly to kinds of fathering that embody that planet’s energy, or that one may tend to attract authority figures with whom one has difficulty. This suggests that the difficulties one has with one’s father or father figures (including, very likely, one’s mother) are the source, or perhaps more accurately the first manifestation, of one’s pattern of dealing with such people in later life. If no effort is made to become conscious and overcome this, one may spend one’s whole life fighting the battles one fought with one’s parents.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Tenth House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the tenth signifies a strong father orientation in the personality. This comes out as a need to achieve, to be and to be recognized as a person of importance in the world, to have others dependent upon one, and to justify one’s self by the degree and quality of one’s performance. An active tenth house does not guarantee fame, but it does usually indicate that one is or tries to be in charge of one’s destiny.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Saturn in the tenth tries to act as a professional father-figure to others. This often comes out as schoolteachers who emphasize discipline and playing a proper role in society rather than stress the expansion of consciousness (which is a ninth-house style of teaching).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Neptune in the tenth can indicate one who has difficulty finding a role or life direction. Often the best resolution for this is to become involved in something that transcends one’s individual importance. This</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">317</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">may be a cause, a spiritual quest, or simply helping others. Pisces in the tenth house has a similar effect.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus in the tenth can indicate someone who is uncomfortable with the whole idea of this house. It often expresses itself as an unusual calling or life direction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part120.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part122.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
