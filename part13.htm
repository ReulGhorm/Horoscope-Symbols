The horoscope is usually represented as a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">25</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">circle, with the person as the center, and the planets and other points discussed above are ranged around the circumference. Thus every point </a>lies in some angular relationship to every other point in the chart.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">Some of these angles are considered significant, and others are not. When the angle separating two points is not significant, there is supposed to be no relationship between the symbols. When two points are separated by a significant angle, the symbols interact in some way: two planetary energies combine or come into conflict, or, when a planet forms a significant angle with one of the crossing points described above, </a>a planetary energy finds a certain area of life in which to manifest.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">There are two cases when an angle can be significant: when it is </a>an aspect or harmonic, and when it is part of a planetary picture.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark33">The Aspects </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">Among the angular relationships possible in a horoscope, aspects are the most well-known and important. Two points are considered by most astrologers today to be in aspect to each other if the angle between them is exactly, or within a few degrees of being, 180°, 150°, 135°, 120°, 90°, 60°, 45°, 30° or 0°. These aspects all come from dividing the 360° of the ecliptic by the numbers one, two, three, four, six, eight </a><span class="p">or twelve.</span></h4><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">It is also possible, though less common, to divide the circle by other whole numbers, such as five, seven, eleven, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and so forth. Astrologers such as Johannes Kepler in the seventeenth century and John Addey in the twentieth have found validity in these less- used angles. As will be explained in </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="a">Chapter </a>6<a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">, all aspects are harmonics of the circle, but to distinguish them from each other, the more usual whole- number divisions of the circle are called aspects and the less-used ones </a><span style=" color: #000;">are called harmonics.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">As with the other symbolic categories, each aspect angle has its own symbolism. The type of angle signifies the type of relationship between planets or other factors. The angle can have a considerable effect on the way two planets interact. Nevertheless, as one might expect, certain planetary energies are compatible or not compatible regardless of the </a>angle between them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="s31">Though we are usually concerned with aspects between two planets or other points, it is also proper to speak of a sign aspecting another sign or a house aspecting another house. In fact, as I will show in later chapters, both the signs and houses may well derive their meanings from the aspects they form among themselves. In the case of the houses, these aspects are not in the plane of the ecliptic. Aspects can be formed in other planes, but with the exception of the parallel and contraparallel aspects described in </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark175" class="a">Chapter</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">26</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6<span style=" color: #000;">, non-ecliptic aspects are beyond the scope of this book.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Midpoints and Other Planetary Pictures <a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="s31">An angular relationship between points does not, however, have to be a whole-number division of the circle in order to link the points together. An arc of any size whatsoever between two points can become significant if there is an arc of the same size between two points elsewhere in the chart. For example, if planets A and B are separated by 17° along the ecliptic and planets C and D are also separated by 17°, all four planets are considered to be linked together, even though 17° is not an aspect. Angular relationships like this involving equal openings between pairs of points are called planetary pictures. As I will explain further in </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark111" class="a">Chapter </a><span class="s24">5</span><span class="p">, Arabian parts and antiscia or solstice points are also forms of planetary picture.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The special case of planetary picture that I find the most useful is the midpoint configuration. This only needs to involve three points instead of four. The opening between planets A and B is the same as the opening between planets B and C. In other words, planet B is at the midpoint between planets A and C.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark34">Using nothing but planets, the Ascendant and Midheaven, aspects, and midpoints, it is possible to do an accurate and detailed reading of a horoscope. I have put these symbol systems in the first half of the book because they are so fundamental. They usually speak the loudest and yield the most reliable results, and for this reason they make a good starting point for interpreting the chart.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are, however, two other widely used symbol systems that can round out one’s interpretation. These are the signs and the houses. In contrast to the point-like symbol systems discussed earlier, both of these are field-like. That is, they are not specific points, but ranges of position. The twelve signs are all 30° divisions of the ecliptic, and the twelve houses divide the ecliptic into segments of varying length. Signs and houses are not energies in the sense that planets are. Rather, they are modifiers of planetary energies, or backdrops against which planetary energies can be viewed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The signs and the houses each measure a different type of planetary motion. The signs mark where the planets are in their apparent progress through the zodiac, which is caused by the planets’ and the Earth’s orbiting the Sun. This is the long-term, mainly counterclockwise type of motion described above in the section on the planets. The houses, on the other hand, mark where the planets are in their apparent daily circling of the Earth, which is caused by the Earth’s rotation on its axis. When seen from the Northern Hemisphere, this short-term motion is clockwise: looking south, you can see the Sun and other planets rise in the east and set in the west. In</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">27</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">fact, the reason our clock hands go clockwise is that they are imitating this heavenly progress: the hour hand, representing the Sun, reaches its highest point at noon. In older texts, the counterclockwise, long-term motion is called secondary motion, whereas the clockwise, daily motion is called primary motion. Secondary motion is what gives planets their zodiacal position, or position in relation to the beginning of the zodiac. Primary motion is what gives them their mundane position, or position in relation to the horizon of a specific place on Earth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part12.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part14.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
