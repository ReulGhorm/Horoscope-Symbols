It has always meant completion, fullness, and totality. In ancient times the circle was used to symbolize the universe when all of being lay in a state of potentiality and nothing was as yet manifest. The circle is also a symbol of the complete self.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark429">Now existence as we know it must consist of the interplay between action and experience. There must be something for one to perceive and to act upon, even if it is only an arbitrary division within the self. Therefore at the very base of existence there must be a duality between subject and</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">object, an actor and an acted upon, an experience and an experiencer. No consciousness as we know it is capable of operating without this distinction. Even when we think about ourselves, <i>we </i>think about <i>ourselves</i><a href="part6.htm#bookmark17" class="s31">. That is, we divide ourselves into an imaginary subject and object for the purpose of self-reflection: I and myself, or we and ourselves. But somewhere in our consciousness we know that I and myself are in fact one, and that our division is nothing more than a convenience for the purpose of conceptualizing. I think this is also true of the universe as a whole, that the division of the universe into subject and object is nothing more than an illusion created for the purpose of dealing with the universe consciously. This is the basis of my belief stated in </a><a href="part6.htm#bookmark17" class="a">Chapter </a><span style=" color: #00F;">1 </span>that we are one with what we experience. For the moment, however, all we have to do is agree that this division of the world into subject and object is a fundamental aspect of our experience of life. Every sentence has a subject and an object or predicate. Most of our language is aimed at defining our relation to something outside of ourselves. “I am here.” “I did this.” “I saw that.” These are all statements normal to human consciousness.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part17.htm#bookmark66" class="s31">In astrology, the subject-object split is symbolized in a number of ways. In </a><a href="part17.htm#bookmark66" class="a">Chapters </a>3 <a href="part21.htm#bookmark79" class="s31">and </a>4<span style=" color: #000;">, I mentioned the Moon-Sun, yin-yang dichotomy. This split is echoed in the basic divisions of the celestial sphere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part104.htm#bookmark438" class="s31" name="bookmark430">To get a feeling for what I am talking about, imagine you are lying in a field, face-up with your feet pointed to where the Sun would be at noon. In the Northern Hemisphere, this would be toward the south. Planets will rise to the left of you in the east, and set to the right of you in the west. When the Sun is exactly due south of you, it will be exactly half-way between its rising and setting, and therefore on the upper part of the meridian circle. At midnight, if you could see through the Earth, you would realize that the Sun is behind you, below the horizon exactly due north, halfway between its setting and rising, and therefore on the lower part of the meridian circle. The horoscope is a schematic diagram of this view of the celestial sphere.</a><a href="part104.htm#bookmark438" class="a">*</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The horizon divides the celestial sphere into an upper and a lower hemisphere. This boundary is represented in the horoscope by a horizontal line, the Ascendant-Descendant axis, which cuts the circle of the ecliptic into two equal parts. In terms of mundane position, this is the fundamental division between subject and object. But there is also a secondary subject- object division: the meridian divides the celestial sphere into an eastern and a western hemisphere. This boundary is represented in the horoscope by the Midheaven-I.C. axis.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part101.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part103.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
