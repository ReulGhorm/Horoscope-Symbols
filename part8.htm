Every symbol in the chart can and often will manifest at all levels of the personality and environment. But some symbols work better at certain levels than at others. Every indication in the chart has a positive role to play, yet it can also be made to play a difficult one. As I have often said in my lectures, it is hard to drive a nail with a screwdriver. Every symbol in the horoscope, every indication about the self, has a level where it is a screwdriver trying to drive a nail, and some people manage to get their entire lives operating at that level. The astrologer strives to eliminate this kind of activity by giving the client self-understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">All difficult astrological indications have a level of manifestation in which they can be made to work out properly. This often requires the individual to go into a tightly defined existence in which there are few alternatives that work easily. The alternatives that do work, however, often do so very well. In astrology there are no indications that are absolutely “bad,” there are only those that are often mishandled.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part7.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part9.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
