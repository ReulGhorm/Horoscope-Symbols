It is easy to divide the zodiac into equal sections, but when we are working in several obliquely inclined planes, just what do we divide? The ecliptic (as in the Equal House and Porphyry systems)? The equator (as in the Meridian and Regiomontanus systems)? The horizon (Horizontal system)? Or something else (Placidus, Campanus, Koch)?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark442">Even the number of houses is not cut-and-dried. At least one modem writer has proposed a twenty-four-house system. And the Irish sidereal astrologer Cyril Fagan has unearthed ancient references to the </a><i>oktotopos</i>, an eightfold division numbered clockwise from the Ascendant instead of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">counterclockwise as we are used to. To make matters worse, the first eight houses of our twelvefold systems have meanings similar to the eight houses (usually called “watches”) of the <i>oktotopos</i>, even though only part of the fifth house of the two types of system coincides in space.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Once we do decide on the number of houses and how to divide them, there is still the problem of how to regard these divisions. Is house symbolism uniformly intense throughout a house, only to change abruptly to the next house’s symbolism at the cusp? Or do house meanings shade gradually into one another? If houses had clear-cut boundaries, it seems to me that by now astrologers would have agreed on the most effective system of house division. But a multiplicity of house systems remains in use, indicating that astrologers are still in disagreement as to where the boundaries are. This leads me to believe that there are in fact no firm boundaries between houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Granted that a house’s symbolism does not stay at the same intensity throughout the house, the next question is, where is the strongest manifestation of the house? This is a different issue from the one of simple planetary strength in relation to the angles. Many modern astrologers assume that the cusp of a house both begins the house and is where the house manifests most strongly. But ancient Greek tradition and modem Hindu astrology both hold that while the cusps are peaks of a house’s intensity, they are not located at the beginning of the house. The Greeks placed the cusps slightly after the beginning, and the Hindus place them squarely in the middle. Thus the Hindu first house would extend from the middle of our twelfth to the middle of our first house. We are left with the question, is the peak of a house’s intensity at the boundary, in the middle, or somewhere in between?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part105.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part107.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
