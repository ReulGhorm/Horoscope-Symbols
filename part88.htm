Its function is to provide a vessel for the energies of Aries so that they can be made manifest. Aries, the solar energy of early spring, warms Taurus, the soil, so that living things may grow.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Taurus, like the Moon, symbolizes a container or matrix for the manifestation of energy. And like the Moon it has suffered from our culture’s reverence for the active and denigration of the passive without truly understanding the role of the passive (see page 54). The passive matrix is, however, consummately valuable, because without it the energy of Aries would never come to anything at all. The container represented by Taurus provides the medium whereby the energy symbolized by Aries can become manifest on the physical plane. And because the container is necessary for the manifestation of the contained, the container is as valuable as what it contains. No value distinction can be made.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Any medium in which energy is manifest affects the nature of the energy and thereby acquires a creative potential of its own. The energy for creation may be from another source, but the style and nature of the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">creativity arise from that which receives the energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Taurus is the remedy for almost all of Aries’s deficiencies. To the erratic energies of Aries it grants stability, constancy, and persistence. Where Aries energies are scattered, Taurus can limit and concentrate them. Concerned with the reality of the physical universe, Taurus can bring Aries’s abstract energies into the realm of real, experienceable effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Also, whereas Aries is fiery and harsh, Taurus is cooling and soft (although among earth signs Taurus is by far the warmest; again, think of the soil warming in the springtime). Fiery Aries is somewhat sterile, whereas Taurus, the fecundated earth, brings fertility.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark365">Taurus is earthy in the popular meaning of the word: it enjoys the physical world. It sees the physical universe as neither an arena in which to perform nor as a tool. Rather it wants to be a part of, involved in, and especially to experience the wonder of the physical world.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Like Aries, Taurus is not especially social. Though it lacks Aries’s rampant individualism, Taurus is content to be by itself, relating to the world in its own way. It does not especially need applause.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It does, however, enjoy the opposite sex, as through it Taurus can experience physical sexuality. Although Scorpio is popularly represented as the most sexually oriented sign, Taurus, the sensualist, is more likely to fit that role.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Aries and Taurus form the first positive-negative pair of signs in the zodiac, and even though they contrast, when put together they represent a whole. Together, they are the living body, animated by the fire of Aries and given form by the earth of Taurus. Nevertheless, it is a body as yet unaware of its relationship to others: its consciousness needs to be developed. This will be carried out in the remaining signs of the zodiac.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Relationship of Taurus to Venus and the Earth <span class="p">I do not consider Venus the best ruler for Taurus. It is easy to see how the rulership came about, but I believe it is time to change our views.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In ancient mythologies, the goddesses of sexual love were Earth goddesses who also presided over the fertility of nature. The symbolism of sexual goddesses was mixed with that of mother goddesses, and no clear distinction was made between the different aspects of the feminine. In modern astrology, however, Venus has taken on the symbolism of love, creativity, and art; and while it is clearly an energy favorable to fertility and agriculture, this does not seem to be its principal concern.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">It seems at first as if we have no planet with a clearly Taurean symbolism, and yet we do: the one planet whose symbolism on a planetary level fits perfectly with that of Taurus on the sign level is the Earth. Taurus</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">is the most perfectly earthy of earth signs. Everything we think of as pertaining to Earth goddesses, everything that relates to adjectives like “earthy,” pertains to Taurus. The Earth has much in common with Venus, but it could never be the significator of romantic love, which is too unreal, not sufficiently sensible, and too removed from the affairs of the daily world to be relevant to an Earth person.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Since the horoscope is centered upon the Earth, how do we locate the Earth in the chart as a point with a definite longitude and latitude? Here is a suggestion. Although for astronomical reasons we treat the horoscope as if it were geocentric (centered on the center of the Earth), it is actually topocentric (centered on a point on the Earth’s surface). The line that connects us on the surface to the center of the Earth goes straight down. If we project that line onto the ecliptic so that we can express its position in terms of the zodiac, the longitude of the topocenter-to-geocenter line is the Imum Coeli of the horoscope, the fourth-house cusp.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark366">In fact, the Earth has never been absent from the horoscope, because houses reflect our relationship to the planet Earth. The Earth occupies half the chart from the Ascendant in the east through the Imum Coeli to the Descendant in the west. Its apparent orb extends a full 180°—how could it fail to affect us tremendously?</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Imum Coeli or fourth-house cusp is the focus of this relationship, and the symbolic fit between it and the Earth is not bad. According to tradition, the fourth house signifies real estate, actual physical land (that is, earth), one’s home, and that which gave one birth. I do not know if this is the answer to the Taurus rulership problem, but it is an idea worth considering.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The fourth-house cusp symbolizes both earthy and lunar matters, and the similarity between these areas of experience may account for the tradition that the Moon is exalted in Taurus. Clearly there is an affinity between Earth symbolism and Moon symbolism, but there is a major difference as well. The Moon relates to emotional security and the feeling of belonging, whereas the Earth relates to practical, physical security, to actually possessing what one needs to survive in comfort. Taurus is like the Earth rather than the Moon in this respect.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The Effect of Taurus on Planets <span class="p">As the earthiest of earth signs and the most fixed of the fixed signs, Taurus is the slowest sign in the zodiac. But slowness should not be equated with dullness. The end-result of the activity of planets in Taurus can be as intelligent, precise, clear, and insightful as that of any other sign, but the result is arrived at carefully, methodically, and with great attention to making sure that the work has</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">227</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">practical relevance. All planetary action in Taurus is slowed down and bent toward practical objectives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The only planets that may really suffer from this are those in which high-speed action is intrinsic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Among the most affected are Mercury and Uranus. Mercury in Taurus can be experienced as a liability, because most people expect Mercurial energies to be fast, and Mercury in Taurus is not. If given a chance to operate at its own pace, however, Mercury is just as effective here as in any other sign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Uranus in Taurus is difficult because the revolutionary, rebellious and instantaneous quality of Uranus is not suited to the slow and gradual nature of Taurus. Signs such as Gemini allow Uranus to release its energies in a series of small discharges, preventing it from blowing up. But the nature of earth resists the electricity of Uranus such that when the energy is released, it is released in a tremendous explosion.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mars in Taurus is also supposed to be difficult, because the naturally slow pace of Taurus tends to cause the energy of Mars to be held in rather than released. This enables the energy to build so that when it does blow off it can be destructive. But if the individual is not repeatedly provoked the energy may never have to blow off. On the positive side, Mars in Taurus can have great steadiness and persistence once it gets going.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part87.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part89.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
