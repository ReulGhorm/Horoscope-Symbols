Values, attitudes toward wealth and property<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The older interpretation of this house as money and movable property works well enough in practical horoscope delineation, but it is clearly oriented toward fortunetelling and leaves us in the dark as to an inner meaning that clarifies the psychology of the individual. More recent</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">writers come closer to a psychological interpretation of the second house by expanding it to mean one’s values and attitudes toward possessions. But as it stands, this interpretation has two flaws.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">First, for all too many astrologers it has resulted in corrupting the symbolism of Venus and Taurus, both commonly identified with the second house, so that they, too, are held to rule values and attitudes toward wealth. This seems part of the general trend of forgetting that Venus is primarily the symbol of love, affection, and art.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Second, “Values” as a kernel idea of the second house is ill-defined. Are one’s moral values signified? Is the second a house of anything one might value: one’s reputation, social status, loved ones? If so, the meaning of the house is expanded way beyond what was implicit in the older and simpler, albeit fortunetelling, meaning. Such broad notions make the second house overlap grotesquely with other houses. It is necessary to keep astrological symbols as distinct as possible; otherwise there is an amorphous mess to interpret. One can pull anything out of a house to explain something one already knows about, but there is no way of sifting through the myriad possibilities to find out something new.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Given some adjustment and clarification, however, associating “value” with the second house is not completely worthless. Instead of looking at values as something we have, let us look at valuing as something we do. What is the function of valuing? Why do we do it? Why does many people’s concern with money go far beyond their need for material security?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Valuing is a process of identification. When we value something, we extend our ego over it and regard it as part of ourselves. Imagine you have a new automobile, and someone is coming at it with a sledge hammer. How do you feel? You probably feel much as if you yourself were being attacked. When people’s homes are burglarized, they report feeling personally violated. The more we identify something as part of ourselves, the more we value it, and the more we respond in this way. If you do not respond strongly to having a possession stolen or destroyed, you have not made it part of yourself. In other words, you do not value it.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Identifying something external to yourself as part of yourself, at least on an unconscious, psychological level, is a process of attachment. Buddhists call this the cause of human suffering, what keeps us on the wheel of life, incarnating and reincarnating. In this idea, I think, is the real meaning of the second house. The planets and signs in the second symbolize those energies through which we attach ourselves to the universe of our choice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike some Eastern and Western mystics, I do not believe we incarnate as the result of a cosmic error, tragedy, or accident. Though we</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are usually out of touch with the part of our being that makes these decisions, I believe we incarnate intentionally, out of a need to encounter certain experiences. That we incarnate is neither fortunate nor unfortunate: we simply choose to do so for our own reasons.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In choosing to incarnate, and in agreeing to play according to the rules of whatever universe we choose, we must attach ourselves to that universe. By making part of it part of ourselves, we gain a stake in it. This is the process symbolized by the second house. Being unattached eliminates a great deal of sorrow, to be sure, but the less attached we are, the less stake we feel in whatever happens in our universe. The trick is to be involved, but to realize that the involvement is merely a choice we have made, one that can be changed. In other words, we should be the master of our involvements, rather than having them master us. The tragedy of the overpossessive is that they become their attachments: most of their individuality is tied up in what they value.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">There are some entities to which we become attached that do not properly belong to the second house. Loved ones are an example. Though it is possible to treat loved ones as possessions and thus make them second- house matters, doing this deprives them of their individuality and makes them mere extensions of one’s own identity. While we may value loved ones, if they are truly loved we do not try to take away their independence and separate identity. Love is the mutual valuing of two individuals by each other without extending the ego of one over the other. In love two people may identify with each other without destroying each others identity. Unlike the second-house process, this process is mutual. The second house is normally limited to physical objects because most people agree that these have no identity of their own.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Social prestige, honor, and status are also things we value that are not second-house matters. These are not <i>things </i>over which our egos extend, they are part of our ego. They are aspects of our self-worth as experienced in our social interactions. One’s self is never in the second house: by definition, one cannot be the object of one’s own possessiveness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Moral values I also reject as being a second-house matter. These, too, are aspects of one’s ego, not external entities over which one projects one’s ego. There is no one symbol for moral values: Jupiter signifies honor, integrity, and honesty; the Sun, self-worth and integrity; Saturn, responsibility and keeping commitments; the ninth house, one’s religious and philosophical values; and the tenth, one’s social honor and prestige as a function of one’s morality. Morals concerning relationships are symbolized by the planets, signs, and houses that affect one’s relationships. And so</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internal Level <span class="p">On the level entirely within the psyche, the second</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">house signifies the part of the ego that is willing to flow beyond the boundaries of the body and attach itself to external entities, making them part of one’s being. Seldom conscious, this process of attachment is usually accepted by the individual as given. We thus unconsciously make ourselves one with our automobiles and our bank accounts, and when what we have attached ourselves to is not upset or endangered, we feel secure. That what we possess may also in fact be useful and enable us to be more effective is a consideration, but one that is secondary to the extension of ego.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark460">Relational Level </a><span class="p">On the level of interaction with the outside world, the second house signifies attitudes toward possessions and other things to which one is attached. It shows how one acts upon and experiences them. It symbolizes one’s relationships to attachments and the actual expression of ones valuing as it manifests in one’s behavior. Also it may symbolize one’s awareness of what one is attached to as opposed to what is attached to others. An example is one’s own money versus someone else’s. And it may represent one’s awareness and experience of attachment as opposed to energies that detach one from attachments.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">On the level outside the self, we have the traditional meaning of the second house as the objects or entities themselves: one’s wealth, physical possessions, and resources. The second house may be fundamentally the process of valuing on an inward level, but on the external level it is the things that are involved.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Second House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the second house tends to increase one’s possessiveness, that is, the number and kinds of things to which one is likely to become attached. But certain planets in this house lessen the degree of attachment. People with Uranus here tend to want to be free of physical-plane attachments, which limit their freedom of movement. Of course, a second-house Uranus can also indicate one who has Uranian possessions, things that enable one to have an offbeat lifestyle.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Jupiter, if aspected in ways that emphasize its freedom-loving side, may also have this effect. But if it is associated with other possessive energies it can greatly increase one’s possessiveness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Mars may cause one to act recklessly with resources. It looks as if one did not care about them, but this is only an appearance. What one is actually doing is demonstrating one’s control over resources by disposing of them in any manner one chooses.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part112.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part114.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
