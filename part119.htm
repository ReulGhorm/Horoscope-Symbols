Inheritance. Other people’s money<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The primary traditional meaning of the eighth house survives from the fortunetelling era of astrology, when astrologers were much concerned with their clients’ time and manner of death. Predicting anyone’s death is now rightly considered taboo, for several reasons. First, it assumes that one’s fate is fixed, something few astrologers today are willing to concede. Second, because many face death with fear, the astrologer runs the risk of literally scaring someone to death at the appropriate time by the mere fact of forecasting it. Modern researchers on death and dying have found that the expectation of death by those around one can be a major factor in bringing it about.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Clearly, with only its traditional meanings, the eighth house has limited usefulness to modern astrologers. But in the light of its core meaning the eighth assumes a vital importance.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In essence, the eighth is a house of transformation of which death is</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">only one kind, and not the kind most often encountered. To be sure, eighth- house energy may be strong when someone dies, but most of the time strong eighth-house energy means other types of powerful transformation. Something but not usually someone dies at these times.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eighth is not only a house of death, but of resurrection. An old order passes away and a new one begins; there is renewal as well as destruction. There is reason to be hopeful when confronted with strong eighth-house symbolism, for it often indicates that something that has outgrown its usefulness is being removed from the life, thereby granting the individual new freedom.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark476">Being above the horizon, the eighth house is likely to be experienced in connection with other people. It is also opposite the second house, which implies that the eighth house is for the other what the second is for the self. From this comes the notion of the eighth as other people’s money. More important, it tells us that eighth-house transformations of the individual come about through the dialectic of the self with not-self. As with the seventh house, one encounters energies reflecting inner aspects of the self that one has chosen not to experience internally. If the second is the house of one’s attachments, then the eighth signifies factors that tend to cut one loose from whatever one is attached to. Let us look at this idea in connection with death and transformation.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The physical world is by nature inflexible: matter resists change. We call something in the physical world material when we cannot pass a hand through it without resistance. Even air offers some resistance to motion. Therefore, when we attach ourselves to anything in the material world, and, by extension, anything that is not material, it encumbers us to some extent and limits our ability to change.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">We need some attachments to anchor us, and some, like money, to operate effectively in the physical universe. But eventually our attachments begin to limit more than support us, especially when they resist the changes that come with growth. It is like a crab which, outgrowing its shell, must shed it in order to grow further. This is the action of the eighth house. It may be our own power that forces us to shed what is no longer necessary in our lives, but more commonly it is external circumstances, especially relationships. Authors like Zipporah Dobyns have noted the connection between this house and intimate relationships. But whereas the self-other encounter in seventh-house relationships enables us to define what we are, the self-other encounter in eighth-house relationships causes us to undergo transformation.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many authors have related the eighth house to sexuality, but it is not</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the only house so related. Sex as a pleasurable activity pursued for its own sake is fifth-house, and as it helps bind an interpersonal relationship it is related to the seventh. But in the orgasm itself there is a momentary loss of ego-consciousness and a feeling much like death that truly belongs to the eighth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Eighth-house energies are strongly emotional. They seem mysterious, weird, and, above all, fated. This is because however much they may affect material considerations, they ultimately operate on a deep, inner level which is usually experienced emotionally.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The eighth house is also associated with psychic and occult matters. The power that enables one totally to transform one’s life can also enable one to transform the world around one, as if by magic. But as a house that undoes the attachments the ego makes, the eighth is ego-denying. Eighth- house energies usually seem uncontrollable by conscious will, and it is difficult to use these “magical” energies of transformation for the intentions of one’s ego. They can only be used if one becomes a vehicle for ego- transcending energies within the self. In this respect the eighth house is much like the twelfth.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">Let us return to the eighth house as other people’s money, or, in terms of our delineation of the second house, other people’s attachments. This comes partly from the idea of the eighth as factors that force us to shed our attachments, in that these factors are often ones in the external world. But that does not quite complete the association. The main reason for this idea being associated with the eighth house comes from its being a derived as opposed to an intrinsic signification of the house. Transformation and rebirth is the intrinsic signification; the derived signification comes from the eighth’s being the second house (money) from the seventh (the partner, the other). In traditional astrology all houses have derived as well as intrinsic significations, but only in the eighth is a derived signification considered as prominently as an intrinsic one. This is probably because death, the traditional intrinsic signification of the eighth, is not applicable in most cases. The idea of the eighth as transformation and rebirth is, however, commonly encountered in life, and I believe that this signification is preferable in most cases to the derived one. </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a>15 <span style=" color: #000;">discusses derived house interpretations in more detail.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Derived and intrinsic significances combine in the eighth-house meaning, “inheritances,” which are someone else’s money coming to us through death. Inheritances may be shown by the eighth, but one cannot assume this house will refer to an inheritance. It is necessary first to establish that an inheritance is possible.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Internal Level <span class="p">The eighth house relates to all inner energies that force the individual ahead toward growth and change. Within the person are the psychological forces that want to reach out and experience the world. These inner forces cause one to shed whatever one has taken on that limits the experience and the resulting growth. This pertains especially to physical attachments when they begin to restrict us.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">These energies are irresistible because they result from the individual’s own inner dynamic. They come not from an external fate, but from one’s own growth plan: they result from one’s life choices. If eighth- house energies appear fated, it is partly because one’s most inevitable experiences are the result of one’s firmest choices. It is also because these are seldom conscious choices, and we often experience both the subconscious and transcendental aspects of ourselves as other than our own.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark477">Relational Level </a><span class="p">At the relational level the eighth house signifies our encounter with outer circumstances that reflect our inner dynamic toward change. Many astrologers have observed the eighth on this level as a house of relationships, because intimate relationships can bring about inward change, often of the most radical kind. The death-and-rebirth experience of the orgasm belongs to this level. So does our ability to use experience as a guide for change.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">External Level <span class="p">At the external level the eighth house symbolizes our experience of all outer-world events and circumstances that bring or represent transformation: the death of others, and situations involving breakdown, decay, and rebirth. It also symbolizes circumstances that force us to become detached from our attachments or to deal with the attachments of others. It is this aspect of the eighth that causes it to mean other people’s money.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Eighth House <span class="p">A large number of planets in the eighth signifies someone whose life to a great extent revolves around change: that is, a person who finds any continuous state of affairs tedious and consciously or unconsciously engineers circumstances that periodically totally transform the life. The resulting crises may appear difficult to others and even to the individual, but such people often feel truly alive only when they are undergoing such catastrophes.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Particular planets in the eighth signify the manner in which one approaches change and transformation. For example, Saturn in the eighth resists transformations, which is why the older astrologers associated this placement with a difficult death. It is not so much a sign of a difficult death as of resistence to the idea of any kind of change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">310</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part118.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part120.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
