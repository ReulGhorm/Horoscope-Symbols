The most-used categories are the planets, horoscope angles, aspects, houses, and signs. This book examines these categories and each of their members in great detail. Less- used categories, like asteroids, hypothetical planets, planetary nodes, fixed stars, midpoints, planetary pictures, antiscia or solstice points, and Arabian parts are also looked at, but more briefly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I call these categories “symbol systems” because besides being collections of symbols with something in common, these groupings have an internal structure. Each separate symbol is related to all the others in the system in a definite way. Thus, in addition to discussing each symbol, I will in this book discuss the structure of the symbol system as a whole. I will often compare and contrast the individual symbols with each other, and sometimes symbols in other systems. In this way I hope to give you a feeling for the overall structure of the horoscope as well as for the symbolism of its individual factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The above symbol systems can be grouped in various ways. In this book they are divided into four overall classes: points in the chart (planets, nodes, etc.), angular relationships (aspects, midpoints, etc.), indicators of zodiacal position (signs), and indicators of mundane position (houses). In this chapter I will attempt to sketch in the astronomical basis for each system and then indicate how each system fits into the overall symbolic structure of the horoscope.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part12.htm">Points in the Chart</a><a class="toc0" href="part13.htm">Angular Relationships</a><a class="toc0" href="part14.htm">Zodiacal Position</a><a class="toc0" href="part15.htm">Mundane Position</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part10.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part12.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
