It seemed to me that in order to synthesize, that is, to produce a coherent, unified reading of a birth chart, one first needs to have a thorough understanding of each of its separate symbols. Only by grasping their essential meanings can one combine these symbols in the creative and intuitive way that good astrology demands.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The section on symbolism soon grew both large enough and important enough to stand on its own. The actual process of putting the symbols together is now relegated to another book, <i>Horoscope Synthesis</i>, which is to be published separately.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The present book examines in depth each symbol in the birth chart. Not only does it include the factors I find indispensable, it also discusses and evaluates most of the other horoscope factors that are in use today. Thus it is a fairly comprehensive survey of astrological symbolism, omitting only some hypothetical planets and sensitive points with which I have had absolutely no experience or which I regard as completely crackpot.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although I hope to give new insights to those who have done much astrology, I have written this book so it can be understood by the intelligent and only slightly knowledgeable beginner. If you have taken a beginner’s course or have read a basic book or two, you should be able to get something useful out of <i>Horoscope Symbols</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">A few words are in order concerning my approach to astrological symbolism. Ever since I first began to study astrology, I have been impressed by its symbolic richness, but I have also been disturbed by some of its features. Perhaps my greatest source of unease has been the obvious superficiality of the interpretations given to many astrological symbols. The houses in particular are often given a seemingly random grab-bag of meanings having to do with the outward details of life. Few authors seem to have tried to understand the unifying principles behind these interpretations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Another thing that disturbed me was that many of the meanings have been oriented toward fortunetelling. Events in the external world are described with little or no understanding of their psychological roots and the role a person may have played in bringing them about. I believe that the primary value of astrology is as a symbolic description of the human</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">psyche. To me, astrology best describes what we are like inside. It relates to external events only insofar as they arise out of what we are and how we behave. For these reasons, in this book I try to:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">1. Unify the symbolism of each astrological factor so that its various significations can all be derived from the understanding of a single essence.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">2. Understand this essence in internal, psychological terms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">3. Explain how the essential symbolism gives rise to the traditional symbolism.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In doing the above I have had to jettison much of what has been said recently about astrological symbols. Many modern attempts to do what I have done in this book have contradicted some of the traditional meanings and ended up clouding rather than clarifying things. I often prefer the older descriptions because, despite their superficial and fatalistic style, they seem closer to the archetypes that I believe are embodied in astrology. Only their superficiality must be overcome.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I request one thing of you. There are a number of ideas presented here that may seem radical. Please suspend judgment until you have had the opportunity to apply these ideas. My own perceptions have gone through transformations because of the ideas of others. I hope you will allow yours to do the same.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I do not expect what I say in this book to be regarded as final. It is certainly not so from my point of view. As long as one lives, one’s ideas should be in a state of growth. Unfortunately, books tend to trap and preserve ideas at a particular state of development. This book is the result of many years of study and reflects my understanding at this time, but I reserve the right in the future to contradict anything I have said should new material and experience present new understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">I hope that this book will spur you on to similar efforts to understand the basic symbols of astrology. In this way, we can arrive at a collective view that is more profound and useful than any we now have. Though I hope to contribute to that end result, I do not expect that this will be even close to the last word.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">October, 1980</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part3.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part5.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
