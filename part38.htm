This is because, as indicated in </a><a href="part37.htm#bookmark178" class="a">Table </a>1<span style=" color: #000;">, aspects based on numbers multiplied by two have qualities that involve the symbolism of two, whereas aspects based on multiples of three have qualities that involve the symbolism of three.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The family of aspects based on division of the circle by two includes the opposition (1/2), square (1/[2 × 2] or 1/4), semisquare (1/[2 × 2 × 2] or 1/8) and sesquiquadrate (3/8), as well as all multiples of 22.5° (1/[2 × 2 × 2 × 2] or 1/16). These I call the “two-series” or “hard” aspects, because of the qualities they have in common.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The family of aspects based on division of the circle by three includes the trine (1/3), sextile (1/[3 × 2] or 1/6), semisextile (1/[3 × 2 × 2] or 1/12), and quincunx (5/12). These I call the “three-series” or “soft” aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark181">The conjunction is in a class by itself, because it could be in the two-series, three-series, or any series of aspects. That it contains the symbolism of all other aspects can be seen as follows: if the conjunction represents (1/1) × 360, it also represents (2/2) × 360, (3/3) × 360, (4/4) × 360, (5/5) × 360, and so forth.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The other aspects were rarely used until recently, apparently because astrologers were not in tune with the symbolism of numbers other than one, two, three, four, six, eight, and twelve. Classifying all aspects as “good” or “bad” makes it difficult to recognize symbolism that is neither. Also, the usual practice of writing planetary positions in terms of their sign position (for example, 23° II 45’) makes it easy to recognize aspects that are divisible by 30°, and difficult to recognize all others. Most astrological analysis is still carried out with the conjunction and the two- and three- series alone, and it will be some time before astrologers are as conversant with other families of aspects as they are with these. Therefore, in the next chapter we will discuss the conjunction, two-series, and three-series in detail before moving on to the five-series, seven-series, and nine-series.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part37.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part39.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
