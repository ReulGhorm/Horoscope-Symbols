Let us take these one at a time.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark349">To Judge the Ease or Difficulty with Which a Planet Will Work </a><span class="p">Using dignities to evaluate a planet’s strength or weakness is often referred to as determining a planet’s “cosmic state.” A planet is deemed more apt to work well if it is in good cosmic state, and less apt to if it is not. Malefics (traditionally Mars and Saturn) in bad cosmic state were considered especially disastrous, but even benefics (Venus and Jupiter)</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">were only supposed to be really useful when in good cosmic state. Older books like Wilson’s <i>Dictionary of Astrology </i>give elaborate tables for evaluating a planet’s cosmic state, based not only on signs of rulership and exaltation, but also on house placement, aspects, and even on subdivisions of signs such as decanates, terms and faces. (Though decanates still have a wide following, terms and faces have been almost completely dropped by modem astrologers. I do not use any of these subdivisions. If you are interested, they are discussed in Wilson and in DeVore.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Although he gives these tables, Wilson is skeptical about their use. I am inclined to concur, and pay little attention to most of these ideas. I find that the most powerful factors affecting “cosmic state” are the aspects and midpoint combinations in which a planet is involved. I feel that sign placement can affect the smoothness of a planet’s expression, but prefer to consider the logical relation of the symbolism of a planet to the sign in which it is placed. I acknowledge that a planet placed in the sign it rules does seem to function more smoothly than elsewhere, but planets are not uniformly debilitated by placement in the sign opposite their rulership. As regards exaltations, some express real affinities between signs and planets, but others do not. The next chapter shows how the signs affect planets placed in them, giving special attention to the planets that are most strengthened or interfered with by the sign. This is based solely on symbolic affinity and not on ancient horoscopes that may have nothing to do with modern people.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To Connect Planets to Houses <span class="p">The second major use of dignities employs the signs as intermediaries to connect planets to houses. According to tradition, there are six principles by which a planet can affect a house. Of these, only the last three employ dignities, but in order to evaluate the use of dignities in this manner, we need to examine all six principles.</span></h4><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 1: The planet may be in the house<span class="p">. No planet-sign affinities are involved here, and dignities play no part in establishing the connection. Astrologers who use houses are unanimous in agreeing that a planet in a house indicates a strong connection between the planet and the house.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 2: The planet may aspect a planet in another house, and thereby affect that house<span class="p">. This principle also does not depend on dignities. Most astrologers agree that, just as two planets in aspect will affect each other, they will affect each other’s houses. And if a planet aspects more than one other planet, as many do, it will affect more than one house aside from its own.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principle 3: The planet may aspect the house cusp<span class="p">. This, too, has</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">216</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nothing to do with dignities. Many astrologers believe that a planet’s being within orb of an aspect to a house cusp gives the planet an important influence over that house. Certainly this is true of planets that aspect the Midheaven, Ascendant, I.C., or Descendant, which are also the tenth-, first-, fourth-, and seventh-house cusps in most house systems and which fall in the same place for a given horoscope regardless of the house system. It is less certain that this works with the other house cusps, which vary in position according to the house system used.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark350">Principle 4: The planet may rule the sign on the cusp or a sign that lies within the house</a><span class="p">. This is the major type of planet-house linkage based on dignities or planet-sign affinities. To give an example, if any part of Leo lies within the third house, then the aspects, house, and sign position of Leo’s ruler, the Sun, would be considered to affect third-house affairs. Or, an astrologer determining the parents’ effect on an individual would not only check the planets in the fourth and tenth (houses that signify one’s experience of one’s parents), but also the planets that rule the signs within the fourth and tenth houses. These planets are said to rule the houses, just as they are said to rule the signs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Things are usually made more complex by there being more than one sign in each house. Because in all but equal-house systems houses can be larger or smaller than 30°, there can be part or all of two or three (and in high latitudes, where the size of houses becomes very irregular, even more) signs within a single house. (Signs that are wholly contained within a house are said to be “intercepted.” Many astrologers—myself not included— consider interception to indicate some degree of trouble for the ruler of that sign and for any planets in the sign.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">In cases where there is more than one sign in a house, the rulers of all signs in the house need to be checked. Normally, however, the ruler of the sign on the cusp is considered the most important. But the ruler of the second sign in the house becomes the most important (1) if the house cusp is at the very end of a sign so that the largest part of the house is in the next sign, or (2) if there are no planets in the house within the sign on the cusp, but there are planets in the second sign of the house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Astrologers who use rulerships in this way also use Principles 1, 2, and often 3. They generally concur that planets actually located in a house influence the house more strongly than planets that rule the house. But when there is no planet in a house, they grant greater importance to the rulers of the signs in the house.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 5: The planet may be exalted in the sign on the cusp or a sign within the house<span class="p">. This is not used as widely as Principle 4, but many</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">astrologers hold it to be important. The mechanism here is the same as for a planet ruling a house cusp or a sign within a house.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 6: The house may be connected to a sign and therefore to its ruling planet by means of the “natural zodiac.” <span class="p">In the natural zodiac the signs are considered to be a universal house system, such that Aries is the first house, Taurus the second, Gemini the third, and so forth. This means that the planets ruling these signs will have a permanent relationship to the issues associated with the houses that correspond to their signs. For example, many astrologers consider Venus, which rules Taurus, the second sign, to be connected to second-house matters like money and possessions. Or they think that Mercury, which rules Gemini, the third sign, has to do with third-house matters like short journeys, brothers, sisters, neighbors, and relatives. Undeniably there are some affinities. Jupiter, which rules Sagittarius, the ninth sign, does indeed have many ninth-house connotations. It is therefore tempting to go along with this principle.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 258pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="344" height="344" alt="image" src="Image_048.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark351">Figure 26. Connecting planets to houses by rulerships</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part84.htm#bookmark351" class="a">Figure </a>26 <span style=" color: #000;">illustrates how, using the above principles, a single aspect, Saturn in Leo in the second house trine Mercury in Sagittarius in the sixth, can involve almost all the houses. Obviously, by Principles 1 and 2, the second and sixth houses are involved, as they contain the two planets in question. And if we admit Saturn to be within orb of a quincunx to the tenth- house cusp, Principle 3 brings in the tenth house.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: right;">Principle 4 brings in six more houses. Mercury rules Gemini, the sign on the cusp of the twelfth, and Virgo, the sign on the cusp of the fourth. Virgo is also extensively present within the boundaries of the third. Saturn rules Capricorn, the sign on the cusp of the seventh, and many would say it co-rules Aquarius on the cusps of the eighth and ninth (the cusps are rather close together in that part of the zodiac when Cancer rises, as it does in this chart). We have just added houses three, four, seven, eight, nine, and twelve. Principle 5, bringing in the exaltation of Mercury in Virgo and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Saturn in Libra, merely repeats the involvement of houses three and four, but if we used Placidus houses instead of Koch, we would have Libra, the exaltation of Saturn, on the cusp of the fifth, thus involving one more house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark352">And, as if we needed more house involvements to confuse us further, Principle 6, the natural zodiac, not only repeats the involvement of the third, sixth, and tenth (Mercury rules the third and sixth signs, Gemini and Virgo, and Saturn rules the tenth sign, Capricorn) but also drags in the eleventh (Saturn co-rules the eleventh sign, Aquarius). We now have a single aspect involving all the houses except the first.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Reasoning like this gives us so much information it really gives us none. Using it in retrospect, we can get almost anything we want out of a horoscope, but using it in advance, it is impossible to pick out the valid information from a sea of possibilities. Obviously, we cannot use all of these principles without hopelessly confusing ourselves: we need to pick out which are the most reliable ways of relating planets to houses and establish some guidelines for their use.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 1<span class="p">. If you use houses at all, there is no question that planets in houses are linked to those houses. Nevertheless, I have often seen a planet indicate circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with the house in which it is placed (or with the houses it rules). Rather, the signification has come from the planet’s own symbolism. For instance, a Venus-Saturn contact may indicate inhibitions in the individual’s ability to relate to others, even when neither of these planets is in (or rules) a house of relationship. But if Venus and Saturn are involved in houses of relationship, it increases the effect. I would say that though the principle of planets in houses probably takes precedence over all the other principles mentioned above, a planet’s own intrinsic symbolism coupled with the intrinsic symbolism of other planets in aspect or midpoint combination with it takes precedence over the symbolism of their house positions. You must consider the planet’s own signification independently of the house involved, even when you take a planet’s house position as significant.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Principle 2<span class="p">. I definitely feel that planets aspecting planets in other</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">houses link those planets to the houses in which the other planets are located. I consider this a particularly reliable technique (with the cautions advised under Principle 1).</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 3<span class="p">. Treating house cusps as sensitive points having the same signification as the house itself would be a useful idea—if astrologers could agree on house systems. I use the Koch system partly because its cusps do seem to work as sensitive points. But this idea needs much research. With the exception of planets aspecting the Midheaven, Ascendant, I.C., and Descendant (which are more definite boundaries than are the other house cusps), at present I must classify this as an unreliable technique for linking planets to houses.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 4<span class="p">. I find that using rulerships to connect planets to houses not only can grotesquely increase the number of houses you have to deal with, it is also much less reliable than Principles 1 and 2. My biggest errors have come from using planets ruling houses they are not in, and I have noted that when other astrologers use this principle their readings increase in vagueness rather than in reliable information.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark353">If you must use this principle, you can gain some clarity by differentiating between planets in a house and planets connected to a house by rulership. According to the great Renaissance astrologer Morinus, the house ruled by a planet indicates conditions </a><i>causing </i>or <i>preceding in time </i>the conditions signified by the house in which a planet is placed. For example (to use some old-time house significations that I prefer not to use), if Saturn (hindrance) is in the tenth (social advancement) and rules the twelfth (hidden conditions that work against one), it suggests that one’s social advancement is hindered by hidden conditions or individuals—not that Saturn hinders both social advancement and hidden conditions. The twelfth-house symbols produce the tenth-house effect. Most modem astrologers do not distinguish between planets in houses and planets ruling houses, so that the picture becomes hopelessly muddied.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 5<span class="p">. Given the shakiness of the whole doctrine of exaltations, everything I have said about the unreliability of planets ruling signs in houses applies doubly to planets that have exaltation signs on cusps or within houses.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 6<span class="p">. I believe the natural zodiac principle to be completely unreliable. Astrologers seem to use it mostly in retrospect to explain a character trait or event when all else fails. It is based on giving identical meanings to planets, signs, and houses—an idea to which I am opposed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To summarize, of the six ways of connecting planets to houses, the least reliable are the three that connect planets to houses through their</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dignities or their relationship to signs. Principle 3, which can connect a house to a planet through the planet’s aspect to the house cusp, is also at least partly suspect. This leaves us with only Principles 1 and 2 to rely on.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Many astrologers will object that the four principles we have just thrown out are the only principles that enable us to delineate houses that are devoid of planets. But, as said above, planets have their own intrinsic symbolism and are related to each other by aspects and midpoint combinations. Even though there is no one-to-one correspondence between planetary symbolism and house symbolism, the two do overlap enough so that planet combinations alone can give indications about the areas of life that would be covered by an empty house. Another clue to the meaning of empty houses lies in the mundane (non-ecliptic) aspects that houses make to each other. This is further explained on pages 311-315.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part83.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part85.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
