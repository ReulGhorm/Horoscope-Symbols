According to this scheme, the signs Aries through Virgo are more concerned with the development of the individual, whereas Libra through Pisces are more concerned with the relationship between the individual and society or higher and more spiritual forms of the collective. Thus a sign in the second half of the zodiac will represent an issue similar to its opposite sign in the first half, but the emphasis will be social rather than individual. Here are some of the clearer examples.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aries-Libra: Aries represents the first assertion of individuality,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">while Libra represents the first encounter of that individuality with other. More inclusively, Libra symbolizes the dialectic between the individual and external entities in general. Whatever may be the case in Aries, in Libra there is an equal emphasis on the self and the unself, and an effort to reach a balance between them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Leo-Aquarius: Whereas Leo is the individual alone and centered on the self, Aquarius has to do with integrating into the collective while at the same time realizing one’s individuality. Both signs are tremendously concerned with ego, but one is in an isolated context, and the other is in a social context.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Virgo-Pisces: Both signs represent the individual’s having to make an accommodation to external necessity. Virgo represents that need on a more immediate level for reasons of personal necessity. In Pisces, the necessity is that of the race, or humankind as a whole with respect to the universe. The necessity to which one must surrender is more abstract, and the surrender is more complete.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One can make similar comparisons using the other signs. I have not done so, because if it is done simplistically it does violence to the basic symbolism of the individual signs. The pattern exists, but it is clearer in some sign pairs than others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part81.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part83.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
