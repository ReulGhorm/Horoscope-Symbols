After many tests with negative results, he encountered the report of a test performed many years earlier that seemed to show that the planets nearest the angles have a strong determining effect on profession. Especially as there were procedural errors in the earlier test, Gauquelin expected the same negative results he had found in his other experiments with astrology. Therefore he was surprised when, even with the procedural errors removed, the correlation held. Using large samples of people prominent in various professions, he found that, indeed, Mars did tend to be near an angle significantly above chance for sports champions, Jupiter near an angle for actors, Saturn for scientists, etc.—much as astrologers would expect.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Later tests indicated it was not profession that the angular planets seemed to be determining, but dominant psychological traits, which would in turn predispose people to success in certain professions. Thus famous people with an angular Mars had biographies containing a high frequency of words like “active,” “eager,” “reckless,” “courageous,” etc.; those with an angular Jupiter were characterized as “good-humored,” “likable,” etc.; those with an angular Saturn were “reserved,” “conscientious,” “organized,” etc. These correlations, which have held up under much retesting, are among the strongest confirmations of astrology.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">One detail of the Gauquelin results ran counter to astrological tradition, however. In traditional astrology, the so-called angular houses— houses one, four, seven, and ten, which come just after each angle going counterclockwise—have been considered the strongest placements for any planet. Very often when an astrology text refers to an “angular planet,” it means a planet in one of these houses whether or not it is very near the angle. But Gauquelin’s work showed the points of greatest strength to be a few degrees to the <i>other </i>side of the angles, in houses twelve, three, six, and nine, the so-called cadent houses, which come just before the angles. Partly this could be explained by assuming a systematic bias in reporting the time of birth late, which is indeed plausible in view of the experience of those connected with hospitals. But even if the births tended to take place a few minutes earlier than reported, so that the peaks would be closer to the “angular” houses, the cadent houses would still be quite strong, not weak as they were traditionally thought to be.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Gauquelin’s work plus the work of John Addey and others indicates that a planet becomes particularly strong four times a day, when or just after it rises, culuminates, sets, and anticulminates. The peaks at rising and culmination, or near the Ascendant and Midheaven, seem stronger than those at setting and anticulmination. And just as there are four peaks of planetary strength, there appear to be four weak areas, each about halfway between</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="s31">the horoscope angles in the four quadrants. I will mention this again when discussing house quadruplicities in the next chapter. Then, in the second half of </a><a href="part124.htm#bookmark487" class="a">Chapter </a>15<span style=" color: #000;">, I will discuss how these findings fit in with the symbolism of the houses. For the present, however, I will just indicate what these findings mean for planetary intensity at the horoscope angles.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="s31" name="bookmark427">For most purposes, at least until further research demonstrates otherwise, I think you can assume a planet to be angular, and hence particularly strong, if it is within about 7.5° to either side of a horoscope angle. Of course, as mentioned in </a><a href="part11.htm#bookmark26" class="a">Chapter </a>2<span style=" color: #000;">, if a planet has considerable celestial latitude (that is, if it is not close to the ecliptic), it may not be as near the horizon or meridian as its degree on the ecliptic might lead you to believe. But usually for all planets except Pluto and the asteroid Pallas, the horoscope angles will give an adequate approximation of whether or not a planet is crossing the horizon or meridian, which is what seems to give it strength.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, planets within 7.5° of a horoscope angle should usually be considered the most important planets in the chart, and the closer they are, the more important. Though lack of such planets does not seem to indicate the lack of anything in the chart, when they are present they color people’s entire personality and may be found in just about every form of behavior or activity that is important to them. Often these planets will indicate the choice of profession, but only insofar as people are adjusted to their world and are able to be themselves. Maladjusted people and those who feel compelled by early childhood training or experience to hide much of their true personalities from the world usually will not follow a profession appropriate to an angular planet but will instead try to manifest its function in other ways. Often the results are less than satisfactory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part100.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part102.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
