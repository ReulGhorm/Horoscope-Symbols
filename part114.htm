Routine interactions with others. Communication. Short journeys and moving about. Brothers, sisters, neighbors, and all other relations except parents<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The third symbolizes a greater number of seemingly unrelated ideas than any other house except the fifth. The thread by which most modem astrologers have attempted to connect these ideas is “interactions with one’s immediate environment.” The only difficulty with this is that it is a purely external delineation of a house that, being below the horizon, should have a particularly strong internal dimension.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The traditional signification of the third house as “lower mind” does, however, suggest an inner, personal, and psychological level of symbolism. But what exactly is “lower mind”? At no time in astrology has it meant the mind primarily dominated by emotions and irrationality. Nor is this “lower mind” anything like the Freudian id, an animal consciousness that motivates one to do only what one wants at the most primitive level. Lower mind usually results in actions that are more or less reasonable, although it is not a reflecting and judging level of consciousness. Its function is to deal with everyday existence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The third-house mind can be conscious. You can reflect upon it at will. If you choose, you can look at your attitudes and mindset in any given situation and see what is happening. As you speak, exercising a third-house function, you can pick and choose your words carefully if you desire. More likely, however, you will look at the world and not be conscious of your attitudes and mindset. Your speech will follow patterns you have used routinely all your life and which seem to suffice for most purposes. The third house is a level of mind that most of the time operates unconsciously, but it can be made conscious whenever you choose. It is unconscious not because you cannot look at it, but because you normally do not choose to. I call lower mind the level of unacknowledged consciousness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Lower mind is an important capability. It is like an automatic pilot. Normal interaction with the world does not require any special attention; you can deal with it in a routine manner. In fact, you must: you cannot afford to consume your conscious energy examining everything you do and say in the course of a day. Occasionally you may find yourself in a situation where you cannot function on this level. You may be in unfamiliar surroundings, have your every move judged, or be in some other stressful situation in which you must be aware of everything. Whenever this occurs, you realize</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that a tremendous amount of concentration is needed. Few have the energy to operate at this level of consciousness for very long. We all need to spend time in which we can relax and operate automatically without self- consciousness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Some activities are hindered by conscious thought. Muscular skills like walking or riding a bicycle are mastered only when one has learned them so well that the processes involved become unconscious (at this point they become part of the lunar mind). One can choose to be aware of these processes, but if one tries to govern them at the fundamental level by conscious intent, they are likely to be disrupted. Some processes must become part of the unconscious patterning of the body in order to work, even though they may have started out in the conscious mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Communication is a major part of the third houses semiconscious functioning. Like muscular skills, using language becomes largely unconscious. When you are telephoning an order to a store it is not the time to reflect on the mechanics of speech. Also, communication normally is the act of establishing connections with one’s immediate surroundings for the purpose of routine interactions. When communication involves an expansion or leap of consciousness, it belongs to the ninth house more than the third.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Short journeys are a projection of the third-house function onto the physical plane. They are simply getting about in your everyday world. The key idea is that the journey does not take you out of the world with which you are familiar on a daily basis. If a journey takes you into a new and unfamiliar world that requires much conscious reflection and consideration in order to deal with it, it is not a third-house experience no matter how short the physical distance. Astrologers have long tried to distinguish between third-house and ninth-house journeys by length of time or distance traveled. I think the criterion is how far out of the realm of everyday experience the journey takes one. LSD experimenters in the 1960s experienced ninth-house journeys without even getting out of a chair; not for nothing did they call the experience a “trip.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Brothers, sisters, and relatives are harder to fit into the “lower mind” scheme. Here we are involved with a common problem in astrology. Although houses often seem to symbolize other people and entities, we have already pointed out that they really only symbolize our <i>experience </i>of these things. In other words, houses symbolize on the interpersonal and environmental level our orientations and relationships to these entities. The third house does not indicate our actual brothers, sisters, and relatives, but rather our relationship to something they have in common, namely, that they are all people in our environment with whom we deal more or less</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">automatically. Relationships with them are not especially conscious, nor are they consciously chosen, like seventh-house partners or eleventh-house friends. They are simply there as part of our world. Also these relationships do not involve any of the kinds of interactions that would place them in the fourth or tenth houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">The above paragraph implies that if we had brothers, sisters, or relatives who were not part of our early environment or with whom we did not develop the particular kind of close, unconscious relationship we usually have with relatives, these people would not be symbolized by the third house. And yet even when we have never met them before, when we do meet a sibling or a relative, we often fall into a particular style of relating. I remember meeting some cousins for the first time. It took only an hour before we were relating like relatives, not unrelated people who had just met. A close common tie, like that of genes, can enable one to relax and act automatically.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Neighbors, like relatives, are part of the day-to-day human interactions we have been discussing. The important thing is not physical proximity, but the fact that the relationship is sufficiently familiar that it can take place with a minimum of conscious consideration.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark462">Internal Level </a><span class="p">At its deepest level of manifestation the third house symbolizes those aspects of the mind that take over consciously learned mental and physical functions and make them operate automatically. As the unconscious basis of the individual’s fundamental mindset, the third house also symbolizes the aspect of the subconscious mind that most influences the experience of everyday reality. The third house is thus, along with the fourth, one of the areas determining habits. The third-house part of habit is the patterning of the psychic energy that makes up the habit, that is, what psychological processes actually occur when the habit is operating. It is much like the structure of a computer program as opposed to the purpose. The fourth house represents habit as a response to conditions or conditioning in earliest life.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Level <span class="p">At the level of dealing with the outside world, the mind works on “automatic pilot” in everyday interactions. This level manifests as speech and routine communications, and serves to maintain one’s relationship with the everyday world. It represents not only the expression of one’s attitudes and basic behavioral programs but also one’s experience of the attitudes and behavioral programs of others in the immediate environment.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">External Level <span class="p">Most of the traditional third-house delineations are</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">290</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">at the level of entities outside oneself. Brothers, sisters, other relatives, and neighbors are all closely involved in one’s intimate, personal world. The third house also represents all situations and places that are part of that world: the neighborhood supermarket as opposed to Calcutta, India. Short journeys are simply one example of going about in one’s personal world and making routine connections with others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">To summarize, the third house symbolizes any aspect of life that does not require the mind to expand its awareness by encountering the unfamiliar. It indicates matters that can be handled adequately by one’s unconscious, habitual patterns of thought and communication.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Planets in the Third House <span class="p">A concentration of planets in the third indicates involvement in many small interactions with one’s personal surroundings. One does not usually withdraw into a corner and meditate the day away. There is too much mental energy not to allow it to spill over into the immediate external world. Often there is little sense that anything important is being communicated: it is as if the individual simply wants to vent excess mental energy. People gossiping or prattling away in endless small talk are an example. Others are physically restless. They are not happy staying in one place within their personal world, although they may not often need to leave the world that is familiar and comfortable.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Most planets simply manifest their energies in third-house matters. But a few seem to alter the nature of the third house or be ill at ease when situated there. Among these is the Moon, whose emotional quality can interfere with third-house functions by clouding and confusing communication. What is said can be so emotional and personal that not even those close to the individual can relate to its content.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark463">Neptune presents similar problems. Here it is not the personal quality of the communication that makes it difficult for others to relate to, but rather its obscure quality. Third-house energies usually operate in a linear manner; that is, one thought, action, or perception follows another in sequence. With Neptune, the sequence may be unclear or difficult to follow. Often this is because Neptune opens the mind to perceptions that cannot easily be communicated in linear terms.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part113.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part115.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
