This system was devised by the Hamburg school (also known as the Uranian school) of Alfred Witte and later simplified by the Cosmobiologists led by Reinhold</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ebertin and his son Baldur Ebertin. Both schools originated in Germany, but both have since acquired large followings elsewhere as well. I have adopted my techniques mainly from the Cosmobiologists.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part35.htm#bookmark128" class="s31">In the Uranian school, midpoints are part of a much larger array of sensitive points created by adding and subtracting longitudes of planets and other points in the chart. Uranian combinations are actually all a type of midpoint, but, unlike the midpoints I and the Cosmobiologists use, the most common type of Uranian combination is based on two pairs of points that share the same midpoint, and the sensitive point is less often the midpoint itself than one of the points in the pairs. When that sensitive point becomes occupied by a planet or other factor, all four factors become tied together in a “planetary picture” which combines all four symbols. Thus this system usually deals with configurations of three planets that make a fourth point sensitive. (See </a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark128" class="a">Figure </a>5<span style=" color: #000;">, page 97.)</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part35.htm#bookmark130" class="s31">In contrast, the basic midpoint pattern that I and the Cosmobiologists use is a two-planet configuration that makes a third point sensitive, and the sensitive point is the midpoint itself. (See </a><a href="part35.htm#bookmark130" class="a">Figure </a>7<span style=" color: #000;">, page 99.) Clearly, the possible two-planet configurations are much fewer than three-planet ones.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark245">In Uranian astrology, planetary pictures can consist of natal, directed, and transiting factors, and even factors from another horoscope, all mixed together. But in Cosmobiology and the approach I take there are no midpoint pairs consisting of one natal and one transiting or directed body, or one body from another chart. All bodies are usually from the natal chart (though the body occupying the midpoint is sometimes transiting, directed, or from another chart). Again, in Cosmobiology the number of factors one has to deal with is limited enough to be manageable.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 44pt;text-align: justify;">Using methods derived from Cosmobiology, it is therefore possible to examine the whole midpoint structure of a chart. The Uranians and Cosmobiologists have left us with simple devices for finding midpoints without any calculating. These are the 360° and 90° dials. Also, in the past few years, computer chart-casting services have begun to offer midpoint lists that can be used in place of dials. I will explain these dials and lists shortly. Using either, one can pick out the important midpoint combinations according to simple rules which I shall outline in this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part51.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part53.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
